[Go up to the main CCC readme](../readme.html) ([md](../readme.md))

You may want to see the [daily announcements slide set](../uva/daily-announcements.html#/) for the current semester.

Slide sets, in the intended order to be presented in lecture, are below (if a link does not work, that's because that slide set is intentionally not in this repository yet):
