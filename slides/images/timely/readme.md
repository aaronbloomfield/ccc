Timely graphs
=============

These are the graphs that have to be changed each time the lecture is presented.  The newest images should not have any date suffix; a date suffix is only added when a newer image is being added.

From the [course introduction](../../../uva/introduction.html#/) slide set:

- Cryptocurrency market capitalization, all-time (`cc-market-cap.svg`), from [https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/): from [2022-01-18](cc-market-cap-2022-01-18.svg), [2022-08-23](cc-market-cap.svg)
- Cryptocurrency market capitalization without BTC, all-time (`cc-market-cap-no-btc.svg`), from [https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/): from [2022-01-18](cc-market-cap-no-btc-2022-01-18.svg), [2022-08-23](cc-market-cap-no-btc.svg)
- Bitcoin dominance, all-time (`btc-dominance.svg`), from [https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/): from [2022-01-18](btc-dominance-2022-01-18.svg), [2022-08-23](btc-dominance.svg)

From the [overview slide](../../overview.html#/) set.  These should be exported as svg if possible; if not, then 1200x600 rasterized and converted to webp (running `make` will covert .png files to .webp).

- Bitcoin price, all-time / raw values (`btc-price.webp`), from [blockchain.com](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/market-price): from [2022-01-17](btc-price-2022-01-17.png), [2022-08-23](btc-price.webp)
- Bitcoin difficulty, all-time / raw values  (`btc-difficulty-all-time.webp`), from [blockchain.com](https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/difficulty): from [2022-01-17](btc-difficulty-all-time-2022-01-17.png), [2022-08-23](btc-difficulty-all-time.webp)
- Bitcoin difficulty, last 3 years / raw values (`btc-difficulty-last-3-years.webp`), from [blockchain.com](https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/difficulty): from [2022-01-17](btc-difficulty-last-3-years-2022-01-17.png), [2022-08-23](btc-difficulty-last-3-years.webp)
- Bitcoin hashes per second, all-time / 7-day average (`btc-hashes-per-sec.webp`), from [blockchain.com](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate): from [2022-01-17](btc-hashes-per-sec-2022-01-17.png), [2022-08-23](btc-hashes-per-sec.webp)
