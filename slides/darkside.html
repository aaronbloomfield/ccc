## Money Laundering

> The process of moving larges amounts of illegally gained money into "legitimate" sources

It's "cleaning" or "laundering" the money



## Money Laundering example
- I buy a house for $500k
- A "friend" who owes me (illegally gained) money buys it from me for $1 million
- I have legitimately gained $1 million



## Money Laundering example
- I run a mostly-cash business
  - Casino, bar, restaurant, etc.
- I also have an illegal side hustle
  - Drug dealing, extortion, etc.
- Every day I add some of the illegally gained money to the *till* (proceeds) of the legitimate business
  - The business acts as a "front" for my side hustle
- This is the reason that organized crime tends to have cash-only side businesses



## Money Laundering
- In 2021, $8.6 billion was laundered via cryptocurrency ([source](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60072195))
- A small group of purpose-built exchanges are used to send and receive such money
  - This makes them hard to track and investigate
  - These exchanges moved 47% of this $8.6 billion figure

## Russia and cryptocurrency

- [Federation Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_Tower): a two-tower skyscraper in central Moscow
- Home to many businesses suspected of money laundering cryptocurrency
  - Or moving funds obtained through scams, darknet markets, and ransomware



## Russia and cryptocurrency
- Hydra: a dark-web marketplace that funnels money to Russia
  - $1 billion in sales in 2020
- Funds must be exchanged through regional exchanges
  - Hard for investigators to follow the money!
- It's been [sanctioned by the US gov't](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0701)



## Evading Sanctions
- In 2018, Russia, Iran, and Venezuela used it to evade sanctions
  - It allowed them to move money in and out
- In 2022, Russia is using it to evade more sanctions
  - After the invasion of Ukraine
  - And Russia's removal from the SWIFT system

# NFTs
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea>
## How buy an NFT
- OpenSea at [opensea.io](https://opensea.io)
- Let's take a look!
- We'll be seeing MetaMask later this semester...



## What does an NFT give you?
- So unclear
- Anybody can download the image
- But you "own" the "thing"
- There is no legal basis for recognizing "ownership" of a thing based on an NFT
  - You could take them to court and claim that since you paid for it, you now own it
  - You'd probably win, after a court battle
- So what does an NFT give you?



## Scams
- Consider DeviantArt user LiamRSharp
  - He had to shut down [his DeviantArt gallery](https://www.deviantart.com/liamrsharp) because of NFT theft
  - See [this twitter post](https://twitter.com/liamrsharp/status/1471940531554959360?lang=en) and [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/ritysg/twitter_sadly_im_going_to_have_to_completely_shut/)
- What prevents somebody from selling an NFT multiple times?
  - Or making minor modifications and re-selling it?
  - *Some* auction sites check for this, but not all, and not reliably



## Sports NFTs: NBA
- [NBA Top Shot](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/15/nba-top-shot-maker-dapper-labs-raising-80m-for-startup-acquisitions/): buy NFTs of "moments" (short video clips)
  - Made $886 million in sales, most in Feb/Mar 2021, but it's popularity has since faded
    - A Lebron James highlight sold for $200k
  - Runs on Dapper Labs' Flow
    - Like Ethereum, but optimized
  - But the NBA retains ownership of the video clip
    - You only own the NFT
  - The license allows: buying / holding / selling in non-commercial settings
    - So you can't resell it!
    - Violation could mean confiscation of the NFT



## Sports NFTs: NFL
- Also by Dapper Labs, presumably also runs on Flow
- Purchase NFTs for "moments", like the NBA's version
- Still in beta?  So unclear



## Sports NFTs
- Deloitte predicted that the sports market will generate more than $2 billion in NFT sales in 2022 ([source](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/sports-nfts-how-to-get-in-the-game/))
- Many other sports are getting in on this
- And some are doing multiple versions
  - The NBA has an "athlete" NFT <strike>scam</strike> initiative as well



## NFTs in Games
- GPU usage to mine cryptocurrency, in return you get in-game rewards
- "Shared" inventory between games
  - Not viable!



## NFT game shared inventory
- The idea: an item in game 1 is written as an NFT to a blockchain
  - Some other character / person obtains that NFT / item in game 2
- This requires:
  - That game 1 and game 2 trust each other
    - Otherwise you could mint lots of things in game 1 and wreck game 2's economy
    - And games make more money off of in-game purchases
  - But if the two games trust each other...
    - Why bother with NFTs and a blockchain?
    - Just have a regular shared inventory
