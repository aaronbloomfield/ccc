## Bitcoin
- Created in 2009
- Bitcoin script is not Turing-complete
- Really only for transactions
  - Tokens possible, but difficult
  - More complicated TXNs are not enforceable




<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## History
[![](images/ethereum/VitalikButerinProfile.webp)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin)
- Vitalik Buterin in 2013: Bitcoin can do so  much more!
- Bitcoin devs: meh
- Vitalik: Fine. I'll do it myself
- Vitalik then created Ethereum (at age 20)
  - Now a multi-billionaire



## Definitions
- *Ethereum* is the system / blockchain / network
- *Ether* or *Eth* (symbol: ETH) is the currency
- *Smart contract* is a program on the Etherem blockchain
  - Analogous to a Bitcoin script on the blockchain
- *Solidity* one (of many) programming languages that compile to Etherem bytecode



## ETH
- The currency of Ethereum
- Current value: see [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD)
- A *wei* is $1/10^{18}$ ETH
- A *gwei* (giga-wei) is $1/10^9$ ETH
  - If 1 ETH is worth `$`2,500, then 1 wei is worth `$`0.0000025
  - Or 400,000 gwei to the dollar
- TXN fees are typically reported in gwei

## Change of Perception
- Think of the Ethereum blockchain as a database...
  - ...of current accounts, programs, and tokens (NFTs)
- We can easily (if slowly) search the blockchain for anything
  - With proper indexing (hash tables!), we can do that in near constant time
- Blockchains store *all* iterations of a thing (accounts, etc.)
  - Our index only needs to store the most recent version
  - And doesn't need to store spent txn outputs



## Tokens
- A token is a "thing" on the blockchain that represents an asset
  - Perhaps a physical asset, like a deed for a car
     - The legal basis for this is unclear, at best
  - Perhaps a digital asset, like ownership of an image
  - Perhaps a blockchain asset, like other cryptocurrency
- Ethereum implements them as smart contracts
- Other cryptocurrencies natively support them (Ravencoin)
- This is a whole separate lecture, coming soon...



## Account addresses
- Keypairs use 256-bit ECDSA (with secp256k1); hashing algorithm is SHA3 (aka Keccak-256)
- Given a 256-bit ECDSA (secp256k1) public/private key pair...
  - Take the SHA3 (aka Keccak-256) hash of the public key
  - Take the last 20 bytes (160 bits)
  - Render that in hexadecimal, and prefix with '0x'
- Example: 0xb794f5ea0ba39494ce839613fffba74279579268
- Notably, this address does NOT change like in Bitcoin!
- This is called an "owned" address



## Nonce
- The 'nonce' is an incrementing counter associated with each account
  - Starts at 0
  - *Each* transaction uses the nonce and then increments it
- This is NOT stored in the account address
  - But it is stored in the blockchain
  - With proper indexing, finding it is almost $\Theta(1)$
    - (Assuming that a hash table lookup is almost $\Theta(1)$)



## Contract addresses
- Some transactions put a smart contract (program) onto the blockchain
- Those need a contract address to be called
- To generate the contract address:
  - Take the account address of who is executing this transaction
    - That could be an owned address or a contract address
  - Append the nonce to that
  - Take the SHA3 (aka Keccak-256) hash of that
  - Take the last 20 bytes (160 bits)
  - Render that in hexadecimal, and prefix with '0x'
- With proper indexing, finding a contract by address is fast
- Let's see an example...



## Byte code
- Take Bitcoin Script, and add just one opcode: JUMP
  - Conditional jumps via OP_IF statements
- Suddenly it's Turing-complete (most likely)
- Ethereum adds a bunch more...
  - But really on JUMP is needed



## Solidity
- One (of many) programming languages used for Ethereum
- A Turing-complete programming language
  - It has loops!  Recursion!  Function calls!
  - And is object-oriented
    - It has inheritance!  Visibilities!
- A Solidity program is called a "smart contract"
- But how to prevent an infinite loop in a smart contract?



## Gas
- Each TXN defines the number of "computational steps" the smart contract is allowed to execute
  - Gas price: how much to pay, in ETH, per computational step
  - Gas limit (aka start gas): the maximum amount of gas to pay
  - Maximum number of allowed steps = gas limit / gas price
- If your smart contract exceeds the maximum allowed steps, the smart contract is not executed
  - And you lose all your gas!  [Here](https://ethplorer.io/tx/0x70fc74551a132a301e5b4a6c1c6dbbfe23d4a6479501b60c6468cd2f6ba0cf3b) is such a TXN
- You can see a [graph of historical gas prices](https://ethereumprice.org/gas/)



## Gas example
- Assume that you agree to pay 200 gwei (ether) per gas unit
  - Each computational step takes some number of gas units
- And you agree to pay for $g$ gas units, say $g=20,000$
- To evaluate the transaction:
  - Buy $g$ gas at 200 gwei; total of 200 * 20,000 gwei = 0.004 ETH
  - As the script executes, it deducts gas from the 20,000 amount
  - At the end of execution, any extra gas is refunded to the account



## Gas examples
- Simple TXN might use 21,000 gas (the max limit)
    - [this one](https://ethplorer.io/tx/0xf42fde83749cd2aa91d4d436a959a8b9e151bf7d87b716aa5b51bde43c557ea3), for example
    - Gas price was ~100 gwei (actually 105.702 gwei)
    - Total was 2,100,000 gwei = 0.002219732760483 ETH
    - At $3,045.41 per ETH (at the time)...
      - That was $6.76 for the TXN
- A complex TXN could use 1 million gas (~$322 at that price)
- See the [average ETH TXN fees](https://messari.io/asset/ethereum/chart/txn-fee-avg)
  - That includes more complex TXNs!



## Exact gas costs
- Solidity is compiled down into bytecode
- Each bytecode opcode costs a different amount of gas
  - 2-10 gas for simple instructions, but up to 1,000 for complex instructions
  - See the (older) table [here](https://github.com/djrtwo/evm-opcode-gas-costs/blob/master/opcode-gas-costs_EIP-150_revision-1e18248_2017-04-12.csv)
  - The exact gas costs are determined from formuals in the [Ethereum yelow paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf)
- The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) will keep computing until it runs out of gas



## Exact gas costs
- The "standard" transaction fee is a startgas of 21,000
  - This is for a typical transfer of ETH
  - Nothing is refunded, even if you use less gas!
  - You can do less, but miners may not include it in their blocks
- Given the current gas costs [here](https://ethgas.watch/)
- Transaction cost in USD is:
  - *eth\_cost\_in\_usd* $\ast$ *gas\_amount* $\ast$ *gas\_price*
- Assume the "normal" gas costs is 88 gwei per unit of gas
  - Thus, the amount paid per gas "step": 88 gwei = $88 \ast 10^{-9}$ ETH
  - A standard transaction uses 21,000 gas: $21,000 \ast 88 \ast 10^{-9} = 1.848 \ast 10^{-3}$ ETH
  - At a cost of `$`2,500 USD per ETH, the total cost of gas is:
  - $2,500 \ast 21,000 \ast 88 \ast 10^{-9} =$ `$`4.62 USD



## Why so high for gas?
- Supply and demand
- Ethereum has a block rate fixed by the difficulty (12-15 seconds)
  - Some transactions are quite large due to the large compiled contracts therein
- But everybody wants to use it, and it can't process the transactons fast enough



## Why pay high gas fees?
- Miners will only choose the most profitable TXNs
  - There are always more TXNs to mine than can fit in a block
- If you pay to little for the gas, the miners will pass it by
- See the [average gas price](https://etherscan.io/chart/gasprice) over time
- You can add a "tip" to incentivize miners to include your block faster
- See [differnt gas fee times](https://crypto.com/defi/dashboard/gas-fees)
  - 200 gwei for gas @ 3k USD / ETH for 21k gas is $12.60
  - It turns out fee computation is more complex...



## Messages
- Like a TXN, but it's one contract calling another
- It also consumes gas!
  - That gas is consumed by the original call
- You call contract A with 1000 gas
  - That call uses 600 gas
  - Contract A calls contract B, which uses 300 gas
  - You only get 100 gas back



## Transaction fields
- Pretty much all the fields in Bitcoin
  - Date, block number, from address, to address, amount to transfer
- Gas limit (aka start gas): the maximum number of computational steps to take
- Gas price: how much to pay for each computational step taken
- A much larger "data" field for the compiled contract



## Evaluating a TXN
1. Is TXN well-formed and valid?  If not, error.
2. Fee starts at *start_gas* $\ast$ *gas_price*
    - Determine sending address from the signature
    - Subract fee from sending account; if not enough, error
3. set *gas* = *start_gas*, and subtract for each step
4. Xfer TXN value from sender to receiver
    - If receiver is a contract, execute that code (using gas)
5. Not enough gas to execute? Revert back to start, but use keep the fees
6. Else refund unspent gas to sender, send gas consued to miner

## Overview
- From the Ethereum white paper: a Patricia tree includes

> a modification to the Merkle tree concept that allows for
nodes to be inserted and deleted, and not just changed, efficiently.



## Trie
A *trie* is a $k$-ary prefix tree that holds (usually) strings
[![](images/ethereum/trees/Trie_example.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie#/media/File:Trie_example.svg)



## Tries
- The key is the characters on the transitions to the leaf, as well as the characters in the leaf
  - The values in the leaves just show the values via the path
- The value is the number by each leaf
  - Not every node has an associated value!
- Any node has a common prefix -- the path to the root
- Reference: Wikipedia's article on [Tries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)



## Radix Tree
A space-optimized Trie
[![](images/ethereum/trees/Patricia_trie.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree#/media/File:Patricia_trie.svg)



## Radix Trees
- Any paths that can be combined, are

## London upgrade: Gas fees
- Before the London upgrade (August 5, 2021), gas fees were computed as described
- Since London...
    - There is a [base fee](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/#base-fee) -- a minimum amount to pay
    - You can add a [priority fee](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/#priority-fee) to incentivize miners to mine your TXN
