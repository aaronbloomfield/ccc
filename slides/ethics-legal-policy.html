## Legal Tender Country
- <img src="images/flags/elsalvador.svg" class="flag"> El Salvador
  - Their other official currency is the US dollar
    - No control over monetary policy!
  - The gov't bought a lot of Bitcoin at it's peak, and has since lost much value
  - The IMF has urged them to reverse course
- Malaysia is considering it



## US Policy
- 2013: US Treasury classifies Bitcoin as a "virtual currency"
  - Other cryptocurrencies are classified similarly
  - This is treated as "property" for tax purposes
- 2018: cryptocurrency business that a "substantial" amount of business in the US must:
  - Register with the US Treasury as a money services business
  - Design and enforce an anti-money laundering program
  - Keep records on customers ([KYC](applications.html#/kyc)) and report them back



## Recent US Policy
- March 9, 2022: [Biden signs order on cryptocurrency as its use explodes](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/biden-signing-order-cryptocurrency-explodes-83336765)
  - The order "urges the Federal Reserve to explore whether the central bank should jump in and create its own digital currency"
  - Also urges federal agencies to "study the impact of cryptocurrency on financial stability and national security"
- Some feel that this is the first step toward the US gov't enacting restrictions on cryptocurrency
  - Although it would be hard to stop it at this point (but not impossible)
  - And, in the current polarized political climate, is anything likely to get done on this front?



## More US Policy
- In 2021, 17 states passed laws re: cryptocurrency regulation
- On Feb 17, 2022, the US Justice Department named Eun Young Choi as the first "director of a National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team to aid in identification of and dealing with misuse of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets"



## US Tax Status
- Cryptocurrency is considered property
  - As per [IRS Notice 2014-21](https://www.irs.gov/irb/2014-16_IRB#NOT-2014-21)
  - This means it's subject to capital gains tax, like stocks and equities
- Capital gains primer:
  - If you own it less than 1 year, you pay your normal tax rate on any gains
  - If you own it for more than 1 year, you pay only 10% on it
- I'm not an accountant, so get another opinion before you depend on this advice



## Tax implications
- The IRS will ask this question on the IRS for 1040 ([source](https://stanfieldodell.com/irs-to-update-virtual-currency-question-for-2021/)):
  - "At any time during 2020, did you receive, sell, send, exchange or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?"
  - 2021 version: "At any time during 2021, did you receive, sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of any financial interest in virtual currency?"
- This is why we aren't making you buy any cryptocurrency for this course
- The "fake" cryptocurrency that you mine and trade in this course does not qualify as a 'yes' for that question...
  - ... as there is no "financial interest" with it since it has zero market value

# Ethics
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea>
## Good uses of Cryptocurrency
- Allows anybody to move funds; no need for an expensive bank account
- Avoid the banking monopolies
- Allows for anonymity online
- It's such a cool technology!



## Bad uses of Cryptocurrency
- It's used for money laundering
- It's used to avoid paying taxes
- Putin has used it to avoid sanctions on Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine
- It's used to enable trading of evil things online
  - Drugs, weapons, revenge porn, videos of child rape & murder, and worse
  - (Tor is in a similar category)



## How to decide if it's ethical to use?
- There are no clear guidelines for how to balance these things
- We see four frameworks to help us make these decisions
  - Virtue Ethics
  - Consequentialist Ethics
  - Utilitarian Ethics
  - Deontological ethics



## Virtue Ethics
- Rather than right or wrong...
  - Or good actions and bad actions...
- ...this focuses on what a virtuous person would do
- So what would a 'morally excellent person' do?
  - Examples: habit of moderation, virtue of prudence, practical wisdom, etc.
- This is a *thought experiment* to be considered



## Virtue Ethics
- How does this help?
- Three ways:
  - Help us understand if we have a moral and ethical obligation, and if so, then to who
  - Help us determine which (moral and ethical) standards to follow
  - Helps us cultivate practical wisdom and good judgment



## Virtue Ethics
- These can be culturally relative
- Consider a benign example of this cultural relativity:
  - Aristotle proposed nine important virtues: wisdom, prudence, justice, fortitude, courage, liberality, magnificence, magnanimity, and temperance
  - A modern ethicist proposed four: ambition/humility, love, courage, and honesty



## Virtue Ethics
- These can be culturally relative
- Consider a non-benign example of this cultural relativity:
  - Sexism or racism: in the past, this was accepted as an accepted part of society
    - Think of societies where slavery exists, or women are second-class citizens
    - They exist today!  They are not all in the past!



## Consequentialist Ethics
- Consider what the consequences of our actions will be
  - Also called [Consequentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism)
- "[A morally right action is one that will produce a good outcome or consequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism)"
- Do the ends justify the means?
  - An extreme interpretation of Consequentialism
  - Like how terrorism is an extreme interpretation of religion



## Utilitarian ethics
- Consider what the 'greatest good' is
  - Here, 'good' is happiness, pleasure, or absence of pain (emotional, physical, etc.)
- Many utilitarians believe that a society that maximizes individual rights and justice leads to the greatest common good (in the long run)



## Utilitarian ethics
- Gross National Happiness: a real-world application of Utilitarian ethics
- A philosophy that guides the government of [Bhutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_National_Happiness)
> [Gross National Happiness is] an index which is used to measure the collective happiness and well-being of a population

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_National_Happiness)



## Utilitarian ethics
- Would an action that hurt one person but helped society be valid ethically?
  - Consider eminent domain seizure of property to build a highway
- What if it were a great injustice to an individual?
  - All these frameworks can be abused in the extreme



## Deontological ethics
- A rule-based or principle-based system
  - Some set of rules or principles inform us of our moral obligations
- Examples:
  - The ten commandments of the Abrahamic religions
  - A set of (secular) laws in a modern society
  - The idea of universal human rights
  - Kant's Categorical imperative
    - Only act in a way that everybody else should act



## Deontological ethics
- But what if the laws are immoral?
  - Again, consider societies where slavery or sexism exists
    - Or other forms of discrimination



## Abuses of ethical frameworks
- All these frameworks can be abused in the extreme
  - Virtue ethics: can be culturally relative
  - Consequentialist ethics: do the ends justify the means?
  - Utilitarian ethics: sacrifice one individual's rights for the good of the many
  - Deontological ethics: what if the laws are immoral?



## How to proceed
- Consider whether the concept is "ethical" using multiple frameworks
  - An abuse of one framework is likely not permissible in another framework



## One commonly held opinion
- Many consider use of cryptocurrency to be ethical if:
  - You are not using for "evil" purposes
  - You are following applicable (and reasonable) laws
  - You are paying your fair share of taxes on any gains



## Nebraska lawyer payments
- Nebraska's state supreme court issued [Ethics Advisory Opinion for Lawyers No. 17-03](https://supremecourt.nebraska.gov/sites/default/files/ethics-opinions/Lawyer/17-03.pdf) which states:
  - Receiving cryptocurrency for payment is acceptable if:
    - It's immediately converted to cash (or equivalent)
      - Prevents volatility from affecting payment amount
    - Notifying clients of such
    - The client's account is credited at the time of payment



## California lawyer payments
- [That opinion](https://calawyers.org/solo-small-firm/ethics-of-cryptocurrency-new-rules-new-money-new-issues/) is similar to Nebraska's
- But what if it's as an advance payment
  - And then it goes up or down in value
- DIfference in opinion about whether it's "funds" or "property"
  - The courts have split on this

## Virginia and UVA policies
- We saw this before, in the [legal issues section](../uva/introduction.html#/legal) of the [course introduction slide set](../uva/introduction.html#/)
- We won't go over it again, but those slides are included here for completeness



## Disclaimer

I am not a lawyer.  But I have discussed this with UVA's lawyers.  However, they are lawyers for me (as a UVA employee) but not for you (as a UVA student).



## Mining legality
- Can you mine cryptocurrency at UVA?
- Consider Virginia statute [6.2-1901](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1901):

> No person shall engage in the business of selling money orders or engage in the business of money transmission, whether or not the person has a location in the Commonwealth, unless the person obtains from the Commission a license issued pursuant to this chapter.



## Mining legality
- Virginia statute [6.2-1901](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/6.2-1901) requires:
  - You get a license if you are in the *business* of money transmission
- Bug if mining is not your business, then you are not directly targetted by that statute
- Thus, so far, mining is fine in the state of Virginia.  But...



## UVA's acceptable use
- UVA has an [acceptable use policy](https://security.virginia.edu/acceptable-use) -- and policy [PRM-011](https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/PRM-011):

<blockquote style="width:85%">
<p>Students are allowed reasonable use of University equipment when it is related to scholarship, research, and public service, and/or approved extracurricular activities. Such use requires approval of the appropriate equipment supervisor, provided the University incurs no unreasonable costs for materials, supplies, maintenance, and/or repairs.</p>
</blockquote>



## UVA's acceptable use
- This means you can NOT mine cryptocurrency that:
  - Uses UVA equipment
    - Either server-based machines or a loaned notebook
  - Uses UVA electricity
    - This means you are not allowed to mine in your dorm room, even on your own machine



## Legal permission
- But... how to teach cryptocurrency without mining?
- This course has received legal permission from UVA's general counsel to mine cryptocurrency, as long as ALL of the following are true:
  - The mining resource use is "reasonable" and necessary in pursuit of the academic goals of this course
  - The cryptocurrency mined has zero market value (a "fake" cryptocurrency)
    - This implies that it cannot be traded for any other "real" cryptocurrency (meaning one with a monetary value)



## Further permissions
- ITS and InfoSec have also approved the use of "fake" cryptocurrency in this course, as long as...
  - Any mining that you do must ONLY use mining software or libraries that I approve
    - The reason is that there is a LOT of malware distributed through shady mining software
  - Any software linked to from an assignment for this course, or provided on the VirtualBox image, is thus considered approved for your use



## Tax implications
- The IRS will ask this question on the IRS for 1040 ([source](https://stanfieldodell.com/irs-to-update-virtual-currency-question-for-2021/)):
  - "At any time during 2020, did you receive, sell, send, exchange or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?"
  - 2021 version: "At any time during 2021, did you receive, sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of any financial interest in virtual currency?"
- This is why we aren't making you buy any cryptocurrency for this course
- The "fake" cryptocurrency that you mine and trade in this course does not qualify as a 'yes' for that question...
  - ... as there is no "financial interest" with it since it has zero market value



## Can (should?) you mine cryptocurrency on your own?
- Not on UVA equipment or on grounds!
  - ITS scans for this, and can revoke your computing access if they catch you
- If you do it on your own off grounds...
  - Be sure to understand the tax implications involved
