# What was Missed
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea>
## Topics we didn't cover
- Due to the ebb and flow of the semester, we did not get to a few topics
- Part of this was due to lectures being three times a week instead of twice a week
  - More time overall is spent on announcements and the start-of-lecture catch-up of where we left off
- Partly it's not that things were missed, but that there is so much more to explore on this subject



## The rest of The Dark Side
- We missed the ending of [the dark side of cryptocurrency](../slides/darkside.html#/); all in the [Solidity Attacks](../slides/darkside.html#/solidity) section
  - GovernMental Ponzi Scheme
  - Call Stack Attack
  - Obscure details of Solidity that make it attackable
  - Rubixi (constructor attacks)
  - `tx.origin` attacks



## Ethics, Legality, and Policy
- We missed the [Ethics, Legality, and Policy](../slides/ethics-legal-policy.html#/) slide set
- Much of this was covered elsewhere, and collected here
  - Policy: where Bitcoin is legal tender (CAR & El Salvador), and US policy
  - Ethics: ethical frameworks, when it is ethical to use cryptocurrency, US precedent
  - Legality (UVA-specific): all covered already
  - Legality (general): money laundering examples, insider trading examples



## One commonly held ehtical opinion
- Many consider use of cryptocurrency to be ethical if:
  - You are not using for "evil" purposes
  - You are following applicable (and reasonable) laws
  - You are paying your fair share of taxes on any gains
- Some further state that only non-PoW coins are ethical
  - Due to the environmental impact of PoW coins



<!-- .slide: class="cclogo-slide" -->
## Advanced Cyrpocurrenty
- The intent was to go over a more recent, and thus more advanced, cryptocurrency
- I'm not sure there is time for this in the course
- The intended example was [![algo logo](../slides/images/logos/algo-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/algorand/) ALGO (Algorand)



## Zero-knowledge proofs
- In the [zkSNARKs](zksnarks.html#/) slide set
- zkSNARK = Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive ARgument of Knowledge
- This lecture set is very math-heavy, and was due to be significantly revised anyway



## Example: The Ali Baba cave
![](images/zksnarks/Zkip_alibaba1.webp)
- A circular cave has a locked door
- Peggy (the "prover") knows how to open it, and wants to prove it to Victor (the "verifier")
  - But she doesn't want Victor to see how to open it
- How can she prove this to him?
  - And not show it to the rest of the world?
- (Images from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof))



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## Example: The Ali Baba cave
![](images/zksnarks/Zkip_alibaba1.webp)
- Victor waits outside, and Peggy randomly chooses path A or B



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## Example: The Ali Baba cave
![](images/zksnarks/Zkip_alibaba2.webp)
- Victor waits outside, and Peggy randomly chooses path A or B
- Victor enters the cave, and states which path he wants Peggy to exit



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## Example: The Ali Baba cave
![](images/zksnarks/Zkip_alibaba3.webp)
- Victor waits outside, and Peggy randomly chooses path A or B
- Victor enters the cave, and states which path he wants Peggy to exit
- Peggy either:
  - Went down that path, and doesn't have to open the door
  - Went down the other path, and does have to open the door
- Each with 50% probability



## Results
- This shows, with 50% probability, that Alice knows a "key"
  - If run twice, then it shows with 75% probability
- To get a higher confidence level, run it many times
  - 10?  100? 1000?
- But this is not a proof!
  - Since there is a $\frac{1}{2^n}$ chance that Peggy was just really lucky
- We'll call it a *verification*
- Note that this is an *interactive* verification



## But wait...
- Why doesn't Victor check that the door is locked, and then have Peggy do a loop?
- Recall that Peggy wants to prove to Victor that she knows the key
  - But not show it to the rest of the world
- The current experiment:
  - Does convince Victor (with probability $1/2^n$ for $n$ tries)
  - Will look staged to the rest of the world
- Peggy doing a loop:
  - Will still convince Victor
  - Will reveal that Peggy knows the key to the rest of the world



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## Where's Waldo
![](images/zksnarks/MartinHandfordWallyandFriends.webp)
- A series of illustrations in books by Martin Handford
- Each image is very busy, and one has to find Waldo
- If I know where Waldo is, I can prove it by showing you
- But how do I prove it without showing you his position?
- (Image from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F))



## Where's Waldo
- Let's do an example!
- This *is* a proof, since I can definitively show where Waldo is
  - There could be *multiple* Waldos, but I have still showed where one is
- This is still an *interactive* proof
  - Although I could leave it lying around, and it would be (mostly) non-interactive
- Note who I verified it to, though...



## Qualities of a Zero-Knowledge Proof
- *Completeness:* the verifier can be (almost) certain that the prover "knows" the information
  - After $n=100$ iterations, Peggy knows how to work the lock
  - I definitively know where Waldo is
- *Soundness:* the prover cannot "prove" false information to the verifier
  - After $n=100$, Peggy cannot (realistically) have faked it
  - I cannot have shared a false location of Waldo
- *Zero-Knowledge:* The information being proven by the prover is never shared to the verifier
  - Victor does not know how to work the lock
  - You do not find out where Waldo is



## Brief (Very) Simple Example
- Given an agreed-upon base $b$ and modulus $m$, I want to prove to you that I know two numbers, $x$ and $y$, that add to 7, but without telling you those numbers
- Rather than showing the numbers, we will perform a *homomorphic hiding*, wherein all numbers are powers of a base
  - So I am showing two numbers, $x$ and $y$, such that $b^x+b^y=b^7$
  - All operations are mod $m$
  - Thus, we want to show two numbers that result in $A=b^7$
- Anybody can figure out $b^?\mod m$, but going back is hard (discrete logs)
  - Assuming large values of $b$ and $m$



## Brief (Very) Simple Example
- I am showing two numbers, $x$ and $y$, such that $b^x+b^y=b^7$
  - Let $A=b^7$
- I compute $X=b^3$ and $Y=b^4$, and present them
- Anybody can verify that $X \ast Y=A$
  - If $x+y=7$, then $b^x \ast b^y=b^7$
  - Thus I know two numbers that add to 7
- But I have not revealed my values for $x$ and $y$



<!-- .slide: class="cclogo-slide" -->
## ZK uses
- [![zec logo](../slides/images/logos/zec-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zcash/) ZEC:  Xcash, the first viable zk cryptocurrency
- [![firo logo](../slides/images/logos/firo-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/firo/) FIRO: originally called Zcoin, it hosed the first widespread democratic election (Thai party primary)
- Newer systems, such as Aelo, are attempting to allow Turing-complete languages to be programmed on a ZK blockchain
  - It provides smart-contract capabilities

# Looking Forward
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea>
<h2><img src="images/logos/btc-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogoheader"> Bitcoin (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) <br clear='all'></h2>

- Pros
  - It started this whole field
  - High value for one Bitcoin
- Cons
  - You can't do much other than transfer funds
  - Script language is rather limited
  - It's kinda boring once you know about more cryptocurrencies
  - Proof-of-work coins are falling out of favor



<h2><img src="images/logos/eth-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogoheader"> Ethereum (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">ETH</a>) Pros<br clear='all'></h2>

- It shows what one can do with a modern cryptocurrency
- It has a Turing-complete programming language
- A lot of developer resources
  - Including things like stack overflow posts for commonly encountered problems
  - Well developed development environments
- Widely used, well trusted (relatively speaking)



<h2><img src="images/logos/eth-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogoheader"> Ethereum (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">ETH</a>) Cons<br clear='all'></h2>

- Relatively expensive to interact with
- Low transaction rate, although that is likely to change with sharding
- Now proof-of-stake
- Technology is now 7 years old (although it has been updated)



## Faster Transactions
- One's we've seen:
  - <img src="images/logos/xlm-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Stellar Lumens ([XLM](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/)): 1k TPS <br clear='all'>
  - <img src="images/logos/sol-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Solana ([SOL](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/)): 50k TPS <br clear='all'>
  - (And Ethereum, once the switch to PoS is all completed)
- Both are meant to have the same features as Ethereum (smart contracts, etc.)



## More features
- One's we've seen:
  - <img src="images/logos/matic-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Polygon ([MATIC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/)) <br clear='all'>
  - <img src="images/logos/dot-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Polkadot ([DOT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/)) <br clear='all'>
- Both have many more features than Ethereum
  - Creation of additional chains, native interaction with multiple blockchains
- Plus they are faster as well



## Better GUIS
- <img src="images/logos/beam-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Beam ([BEAM](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/beam/)) GUI:<br clear='all'>

<img src="images/conclusion/beam-desktop.webp" style="padding:0;background:transparent">

Image from [Beam's home page](https://beam.mw/)



## Different development languages
- <img src="images/logos/eth-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Ethereum has Solidity, of course (and others) <br clear='all'>
- <img src="images/logos/dot-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Polkadot uses Rust <br clear='all'>
- <img src="images/logos/sol-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Solana uses C, C++, and Rust <br clear='all'>
- <img src="images/logos/matic-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Polygon uses Javascript and Solidity <br clear='all'>
- <img src="images/logos/atom-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Cosmos uses Go <br clear='all'>
- Many of the newer cryptocurrencies use lesser known languages (Erlang, Vue, Michelson, etc.)



## Is buying a miner worth it?
- Numbers as of December 2022
- A high-end graphics card uses about `$`1 per day in electrical costs and generates `$`0.40 in cryptocurrency profit
  - It's worth it if you don't pay for your electricity usage
- A Bitcoin ASIC miner, such as the [Avalon 1166 miner](https://canaan.io/product/a1166pro-s-75t), uses about `$`9 in electrical costs and generates maybe half that in profit



## Where is the field going
- If we could predict this, we'd all be rich on Bitcoin
- Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, has a [blog](https://vitalik.ca/)
- [Reddit post: Best crypto life hacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rtlsoi/best_lifehacks_in_crypto_that_beginners_should/)
- Reddit post: How I accumulated my wealth by looking at pages 10 and beyond on Coingecko
  - The [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u5je3f/how_i_accumulated_my_wealth_by_looking_at_pages/) was deleted, but is available on [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20220417124008/https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u5je3f/how_i_accumulated_my_wealth_by_looking_at_pages/)
- This is, of course, if it can ever get past all the scams and thefts...



## Want to start a cryptocurrency?
- Starting it is easy
  - Make a ERC-20 token or fork existing source code
- Getting people to trust it is *hard*
  - There are 100 coins created *each day* -- what will make yours stand out?
- You need something different that fills a new niche
  - That probably means a new code base, not an ERC-20 token
- And a *lot* of patience to get people to adopt it
- (If you do this, let me know!)

## Topics we didn't cover
- Mining algorithms, CUDA (mining on a GPU)
- P2P networking
  - That's more in the realm of a Networks class
- Multi-blockchain wallets and how they work
- Mining pools
- More modern cryptocurrency systems, such as Algorand
- This column of slides is meant to be very brief



## What didn't work well
- Debugging Solidity programs
  - Although I think it went about as well as it could have gone...
- General Remix & geth issues
- My slowness in (some) grading & (all) regrading
- Arbitrage was rougher than anticipated



## What did work well
- The course blockchain and the explorer
- The lecture topics
- The homeworks, and how they built upon each other over the course of the semester
- The few HWs from last semester that had issues didn't have those issues this semester
  - Arbitrage doesn't fall into that category...
- I didn't trip and fall off of the silly stage in the classroom
- TAs who took the class!  And lots of office hours
- Being able to have cryptocurrency memes as the first daily announcements slide of the day



## Did I push too hard?
- I feel that the frustration was more caused by other issues than the raw work load:
  - Problems debugging Solidity
  - Remix acting up
- Factoring that out, was it too hard?



## Changes for next semester
- Restart the blockchain, and with a different chain ID
- Same course structure, same homeworks
- Add an advanced cryptocurrency lecture, such as Algorand
- More diagrams in the lectures
- Fix the Arbitrage homework



## Let me know your comments!
- Please send us your feedback!
  - Either by e-mail or anonymously or on the course surveys
- Please fill out the course surveys!



<h2>Have a great break!</h2>
