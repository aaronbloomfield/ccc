    <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea>
<h2><img src="images/logos/btc-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogoheader"> Bitcoin (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) <br clear='all'></h2>

- Pros
  - It started this whole field
  - High value for one Bitcoin
- Cons
  - You can't do much other than transfer funds
  - Script language is rather limited
  - It's kinda boring once you know about more cryptocurrencies
  - Proof-of-work coins are falling out of favor



<h2><img src="images/logos/eth-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogoheader"> Ethereum (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">ETH</a>) Pros<br clear='all'></h2>

- It shows what one can do with a modern cryptocurrency
- It has a Turing-complete programming language
- A lot of developer resources
  - Including things like stack overflow posts for commonly encountered problems
  - Well developed development environments
- Widely used, well trusted (relatively speaking)



<h2><img src="images/logos/eth-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogoheader"> Ethereum (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">ETH</a>) Cons<br clear='all'></h2>

- Relatively expensive to interact with
- Low transaction rate, although that is likely to change with sharding
- Now proof-of-stake
- Technology is now 7 years old (although it has been updated)



## Faster Transactions
- One's we've seen:
  - <img src="images/logos/xlm-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Stellar Lumens ([XLM](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/)): 1k TPS <br clear='all'>
  - <img src="images/logos/sol-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Solana ([SOL](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/)): 50k TPS <br clear='all'>
  - (And Ethereum, once the switch to PoS is all completed)
- Both are meant to have the same features as Ethereum (smart contracts, etc.)



## More features
- One's we've seen:
  - <img src="images/logos/matic-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Polygon ([MATIC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/)) <br clear='all'>
  - <img src="images/logos/dot-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Polkadot ([DOT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/)) <br clear='all'>
- Both have many more features than Ethereum
  - Creation of additional chains, native interaction with multiple blockchains
- Plus they are faster as well



## Better GUIS
- <img src="images/logos/beam-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Beam ([BEAM](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/beam/)) GUI:<br clear='all'>

<img src="images/conclusion/beam-desktop.webp" style="padding:0;background:transparent">

Image from [Beam's home page](https://beam.mw/)



## Different development languages
- <img src="images/logos/eth-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Ethereum has Solidity, of course (and others) <br clear='all'>
- <img src="images/logos/dot-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Polkadot uses Rust <br clear='all'>
- <img src="images/logos/sol-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Solana uses C, C++, and Rust <br clear='all'>
- <img src="images/logos/matic-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Polygon uses Javascript and Solidity <br clear='all'>
- <img src="images/logos/atom-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Cosmos uses Go <br clear='all'>
- Many of the newer cryptocurrencies use lesser known languages (Erlang, Vue, Michelson, etc.)



## Is buying a miner worth it?
- Numbers as of December 2022
- A high-end graphics card uses about `$`1 per day in electrical costs and generates `$`0.40 in cryptocurrency profit
  - It's worth it if you don't pay for your electricity usage
- A Bitcoin ASIC miner, such as the [Avalon 1166 miner](https://canaan.io/product/a1166pro-s-75t), uses about `$`9 in electrical costs and generates maybe half that in profit



## Where is the field going
- If we could predict this, we'd all be rich on Bitcoin
- Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, has a [blog](https://vitalik.ca/)
- [Reddit post: Best crypto life hacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rtlsoi/best_lifehacks_in_crypto_that_beginners_should/)
- Reddit post: How I accumulated my wealth by looking at pages 10 and beyond on Coingecko
  - The [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u5je3f/how_i_accumulated_my_wealth_by_looking_at_pages/) was deleted, but is available on [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20220417124008/https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u5je3f/how_i_accumulated_my_wealth_by_looking_at_pages/)
- This is, of course, if it can ever get past all the scams and thefts...



## Want to start a cryptocurrency?
- Starting it is easy
  - Make a ERC-20 token or fork existing source code
- Getting people to trust it is *hard*
  - There are 100 coins created *each day* -- what will make yours stand out?
- You need something different that fills a new niche
  - That probably means a new code base, not an ERC-20 token
- And a *lot* of patience to get people to adopt it
- (If you do this, let me know!)

## Topics we didn't cover
- Mining algorithms, CUDA (mining on a GPU)
- P2P networking
  - That's more in the realm of a Networks class
- Multi-blockchain wallets and how they work
- Mining pools
- More modern cryptocurrency systems, such as Algorand



## What didn't work well
- Debugging Solidity programs
  - Although I think it went about as well as it could have gone...
- VirtualBox was not a great solution for those who used it
- My slowness in grading & regrading
- The BTC test network dying right as HW P3 (BTC scripting) was due



## What did work well
- The course blockchain and the explorer
- The lecture topics
- The homeworks, and how they built upon each other over the course of the semester
- The two or three HWs from last semester that had issues didn't have those issues this semester
- I didn't trip and fall off of the silly stage in the classroom
- TAs who took the class!  And lots of office hours



## Did I push too hard?
- I feel that the frustration was more caused by other issues than the raw work load:
  - Problems debugging Solidity
  - Remix acting up
- Factoring that out, was it too hard?



## Changes for next semester
- Restart the blockchain, and with a different chain ID
- Same course structure, same homeworks
- Add an advanced cryptocurrency lecture, such as Algorand
- More diagrams in the lectures



## Let me know your comments!
- Please send us your feedback!
  - Either by e-mail or anonymously or on the course surveys
- Please fill out the course surveys!



<h2>Have a great break!</h2>
