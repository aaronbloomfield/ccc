# Miscellaneous Topics
	  </textarea></section>

	  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea>
## Miscellaneous Topics
- These are a few topics that weren't covered elsewhere, but you should know about
- They are:
  - Forks
  - Oracles
  - Stablecoins



## Cryptocurrency "Forks"
- There are four different meanings of "fork" with regard to cryptocurrencies
  - Uncle / orphan / ommer nodes
  - Soft fork 
  - Hard fork
  - Source code fork
    </textarea></section>

<img src="images/mining/orphan/orphan.dot.5.svg" style="width:250px">

- Given a starting block number (here, 1000)
- A miner mines a given transaction into a block
- But another miner mines a different block without that TXN
- That other block gets a confirmation
- And then one more



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## Uncle / Orphan / Ommer nodes

<img src="images/mining/orphan/orphan.dot.6.svg" style="width:250px">

- Given a starting block number (here, 1000)
- A miner mines a given transaction into a block
- But another miner mines a different block without that TXN
- That other block gets a confirmation
- And then one more
- Eventually the block with the TXN is discarded
  - As it is not part of the longest chain anymore
    </textarea></section>



    <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea>
## Uncle / Orphan / Ommer nodes
- Bitcoin calls these *orphan nodes*
- Ethereum used to call them *uncle nodes*
  - But that is gender-specific
  - Now they are called *ommer nodes*
    - Ommer is a gender-neutral version of aunt or uncle
    - Like "sibling" instead of brother or sister
- What happens to that TXN?
  - Other miners will likely pick it up
  - Wallet software (or equivalent) will re-send it if it "disappears"
    - Or at least notify you that it was not mined
- This is why we can't all mine the blockchian in this class!
  - There is no effective way to ensure it is not discarded



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## Soft forks

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*FBNBdZKQOI2FfJMRBto5pQ.jpeg" style="padding:0;background:transparent">

- Non-token crypto-currencies usually have a group of developers
  - Occasional changes are made to the protocol / mining algorithm / etc.
  - Bitcoin via [BIPs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/), Ethereum via [EIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/), etc.
- Sometimes called a *consensus fork*
- Generally all the uses of the cryptocurrency (eventually) adopt the change
- These forks are backward-compatible
  - At least until everybody switches over



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## Soft forks

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*FBNBdZKQOI2FfJMRBto5pQ.jpeg" style="padding:0;background:transparent">

- How to get all the miners to adopt it?
  - Release the updated source code
  - The agreed-upon change will state that at some point, all further blocks *must* have that change
  - That point could be when:
    - Some number (say, 75%) of the miners have adopted this change
    - After some date/time
- Example: Bitcoin's [Segregated Witness](bitcoin.html#/segwit) from 2015
  - Defined in [BIP 141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki)



## Hard forks
- A change is proposed that some users do *NOT* want to adopt
  - Or that is not backwards-compatible
- Example: Ethereum Classic
  - Recall that The &ETH;AO had a bug, which endangered the perception and trust of the Ethereum as a whole
  - The fix was to roll back the blockchain to before the hack to fix it
  - This [split the users](applications.html#/etcsplit), as some didn't want to make the change
  - <img src="images/logos/etc-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Now Ethereum Classic is the blockchain *without* the fix <br clear='all'>
  - <img src="images/logos/eth-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Ethereum is the blockchain *with* the fix <br clear='all'>



## Source code forks
- You can make a new cryptocurrency by:
  - Take a tested open source code base
  - Make a the modifications you want
- <img src="images/logos/rvn-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> The [Ravencoin source code](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin) is based off of the [Bitcoin source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin)
- Changes:
  - 1000x as many coins
  - Native support for assets
    - Could be NFTs, but can represent any digital or physical item
  - Different PoW hashes to avoid ASIC monopolization



## Oracles
- A smart contract can only use the data on the blockchain
- Complex situations require more data than that:
  - Current exchange rates
  - Random numbers
  - The ability to interact with other blockchains
- The solution: Oracles

> Oracle (n): a person who delivers authoritative, wise, or highly regarded and influential pronouncements



## Oracles
We can easily create an oracle:

```
contract Oracle {
    address oracle;
    uint public price;

    constructor() {
        oracle = msg.sender;
    }

    function updatePrice (uint update) external {
        require (msg.sender == oracle, 
                 "Only the Oracle can update this");
        price = update;
    }
}
```
- Getting people to trust it is another matter



## Oracle: trusted signer
![](images/conclusion/oracles/oracles.dot.1.svg)
- The oracle signer (aka deployer) updates the price, and anybody can read it
  - This works well when the source is centralized
  - Such as the oracles on Ethereum that interact with the Polkadot or Polygon chains
- But a corrupt signer can maliciously manipulate the price



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## Oracle: $m$ of $n$ signers
![](images/conclusion/oracles/oracles.dot.2.svg)
- So we have multiple signers
- We expect some variance in the values
  - Different exchanges will provide slightly different exchange rates
- We have to take the *median* value, not the *mean*
  - We'll see why next



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## Oracle: $m$ of $n$ signers
![](images/conclusion/oracles/oracles.dot.3.svg)
- What if some nodes are corrupted?
- We have to take the *median* value, not the *mean*
  - Here the mean is `$`71
  - The median is `$`101
- If more than half are trustworthy, then the oracle will have a correct price
  - Less than half can be traitors!



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## Oracle: Schelling oracles
![](images/conclusion/oracles/oracles.dot.4.svg)
- Each signer puts a *stake* in their vote
- We accept the value that has the most stake
- Traitors have their stake *slahsed*
  - Although we allow for some variance in the price
  - But if we allow for too much variance, a traitor can just give a valid, but low, price



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## Schelling oracles & whales
![](images/conclusion/oracles/oracles.dot.5.svg)
- A *whale* could put in a huge stake to manipulate the price
  - Knowing full well s/he will lose their stake
  - Presumably so s/he can make a (bigger) profit off of the price difference



## Stablecoins
- A coin whose value is meant to not be volatile
- Usually tagged in value to a fiat currency
- Examples we'll see here:
  - <img src="images/logos/usdc-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> USD Coin ([USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/)) <br clear='all'>
  - <img src="images/logos/usdt-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Tether ([USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/)) <br clear='all'>
  - <img src="images/logos/dai-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> DAI ([DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/)) <br clear='all'>
    - We've seen DAI before: it's a token cryptocurrency



<h2><img src="images/logos/usdc-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogoheader"> USD Coin (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/">USDC</a>) <br clear='all'></h2>

- Managed by a consortium named Centre, which is founded by Coinbase (and others)
- Backed by actual monetary investments in various accounts
  - An accounting agency (Grant Thornton) attests monthly to these deposits
- If you buy one, the money you pay goes into these accounts
- But how risky are those deposits?
  - If their value goes down, the number of USDC does not change!
- Not backed by the US government in any way!



<h2><img src="images/logos/usdt-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogoheader"> Tether (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/">USDT</a>) <br clear='all'></h2>

- Similar to USDC in how it works
- Run by Tether Ltd
- As per [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/), it's has the 3rd largest market capitalization (`$`83 billion as of 5/1/22) 
  - After Bitcoin (`$`734 billion) and Ethereum (`$`340 billion)
  - USD Coin is 5th at `$`49 billion
- Scandal-ridden
  - 2019: NY AG accuses Tether of hiding a `$`850 million loss
  - It's really unclear where their reserves are held
  - Many accusations that their reserves are much less than the 1:1 ratio they claim
- Not backed by the US government in any way!



<h2><img src="images/logos/dai-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogoheader"> Dai (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/">DAI</a>) <br clear='all'></h2>

- An ERC-20 token cryptocurrency we've [talked about before](tokens.html#/dai)
- Run by [MakerDAO](https://cryptonews.com/coins/maker/) via an Ethereum smart contract
  - [MakerDOA's whitepaper](https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/)
- Uses a series of margin trades and shifts of assets to have its value remain stable despite cryptocurrency volatility



## Stablecoin categories
- Fiat-collateralized
  - Rely on a centralized institution with reserves
  - Examples: Tether, USD Coin, TrueUSD
- Crypto-collateralized
  - Use cryptocurrency assets as collateral
  - Examples: Dai (DAI) & Maker (MKR); Havven (HAV) & nUSD, Bitshares (BTS) BitUSD
- Algorithmic non-collateralized
  - Use software-based economic models to maintain stability
  - Examples: Basis, Kowala, Carbon, Fragments
- Hybrid stablecoins
  - A blend of the above approaches
  - Examples: Reserve, Saga, Aurora - Boreal

# Looking Forward
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea>
<h2><img src="images/logos/btc-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogoheader"> Bitcoin (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) <br clear='all'></h2>

- Pros
  - It started this whole field
  - High exchange rate for one Bitcoin
- Cons
  - You can't do much other than transfer funds
  - Script language is rather limited
  - (It's kinda boring once you know about more cryptocurrencies)



<h2><img src="images/logos/eth-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogoheader"> Ethereum (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">ETH</a>) Pros<br clear='all'></h2>

- It shows what one can do with a modern cryptocurrency
- It has a Turing-complete programming language
- A lot of developer resources
  - Including things like stack overflow posts for commonly encountered problems
  - Well developed development environments
- Widely used, well trusted (relatively speaking)




<h2><img src="images/logos/eth-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogoheader"> Ethereum (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">ETH</a>) Cons<br clear='all'></h2>

- Expensive to interact with
- High volatility in the fees
- Low transaction rate
- Still PoW
- Technology is now 7 years old



## Faster Transactions
- One's we've seen:
  - <img src="images/logos/xlm-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Stellar Lumens ([XLM](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/)): 1k TPS <br clear='all'>
  - <img src="images/logos/sol-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Solana ([SOL](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/)): 50k TPS <br clear='all'>
- Both are meant to have the same features as Ethereum (smart contracts, etc.)



## More features
- One's we've seen:
  - <img src="images/logos/matic-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Polygon ([MATIC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/)) <br clear='all'>
  - <img src="images/logos/dot-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Polkadot ([DOT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/)) <br clear='all'>
- Both have many more features than Ethereum
  - Creation of additional chains, native interaction with multiple blockchains
- Plus they are faster as well



## Better GUIS
- <img src="images/logos/beam-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Beam ([BEAM](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/beam/)) GUI:<br clear='all'>

<img src="images/conclusion/beam-desktop.webp" style="padding:0;background:transparent">

Image from [Beam's home page](https://beam.mw/)



## Different development languages
- <img src="images/logos/eth-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Ethereum has Solidity, of course (and others) <br clear='all'>
- <img src="images/logos/dot-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Polkadot uses Rust <br clear='all'>
- <img src="images/logos/sol-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Solana uses C, C++, and Rust <br clear='all'>
- <img src="images/logos/matic-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Polygon uses Javascript and Solidity <br clear='all'>
- <img src="images/logos/atom-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Cosmos uses Go <br clear='all'>
- Many of the newer cryptocurrencies use lesser known languages (Erlang, Vue, Michelson, etc.)



## Is buying a GPU miner worth it?
- Consider a Nvidia 3090 GPU
  - Currently selling for `$`1,800 on Amazon
- It can make [`$`5.27 per day in ETH](https://2cryptocalc.com/gpu/24h/3090/1)
  - But not for long, because ETH is going to proof-of-stake
  - It can make about `$`3 per day otherwise
  - Minus about `$`1 per day in electricity
  - And you have to buy the machine it connects to
- `$`2 per day will pay off the miner is 900 days (2.5 years)
- Unless...
  - If the overall hash rate goes up, the amount you get per day goes down
  - Nvidia is coming out with 4090 GPUs in the fall that will have double the speed



## Is buying a Bitcoin miner worth it?
- Consider the [Avalon 1166 miner](https://canaan.io/product/a1166pro-s-75t)
- Current profit per day is under `$`3 once electricity is considered
  - And it's going down as the Bitcoin hashrate goes up
- That will pay itself off in 1,500 days (4 years!)



## Where is the field going
- If we could predict this, we'd all be rich on Bitcoin
- Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, has a [blog](https://vitalik.ca/)
- [Reddit post: Best crypto life hacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rtlsoi/best_lifehacks_in_crypto_that_beginners_should/)
- Reddit post: How I accumulated my wealth by looking at pages 10 and beyond on Coingecko
  - The [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u5je3f/how_i_accumulated_my_wealth_by_looking_at_pages/) was deleted, but is available on [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20220417124008/https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u5je3f/how_i_accumulated_my_wealth_by_looking_at_pages/)



## Want to start a cryptocurrency?
- Starting it is easy
  - Make a ERC-20 token or fork existing source code
- Getting people to trust it is *hard*
  - There are 100 coins created *each day* -- what will make yours stand out?
- You need something different that fills a new niche
  - That probably means a new code base, not an ERC-20 token
- And a *lot* of patience to get people to adopt it
- (If you do this, let me know!)

## Topics we didn't cover
- Mining algorithms, CUDA (mining on a GPU)
- P2P networking
  - That's more in the realm of a Networks class
- Multi-blockchain wallets and how they work
- Mining pools
- More modern cryptocurrency systems
  - That would really need a follow-on course



## What didn't work well
- Debugging Solidity programs
- Solidity IDE crashing in the middle of the semester
- My slowness in grading & regrading
- Roughness with some of the homeworks
- The zkSNARKs lectures
- Blockchain disconnections



## What did work well
- You all did not get a "half course"
- Using our own blockchain for the course
- The lecture topics
- The homeworks (mostly)
- I didn't trip and fall off of the silly stage in the classroom



## Did I push too hard?
- I feel that the frustration was more caused by other issues than the raw work load:
  - Problems debugging Solidity
  - Homework specification issues
  - Remix acting up
- Factoring that out, was it too hard?



## Changes for next semester
- Restart the blockchain, and with a different chain ID
- Same course structure
  - Likely same homeworks, although cleaned up a bit
- Four undergraduate TAs!
  - Our two graduate TAs are graduating
- Many more diagrams in the lectures



## Let me know your comments!
- Please send us your feedback!
  - Either by e-mail or anonymously or on the course surveys
- Please fill out the course surveys!
