## Stablecoins
- A coin whose value is meant to not be volatile
- Usually tagged in value to a fiat currency
  - We'll use the US Dollar
- *Collateralized* stablecoins means that there is some collateral (financial investment) backing up the value of the stablecoin



## Definitions

> Peg: to have the price of one asset (say, a cryptocurrency) exactly match the price of another asset (say, USD)

> Depeg: when the asset (say, a cryptocurrency) looses its pegged price against the other asset (say, USD)



## Types

</table>


- Algorithmic?



## Examples
- Examples we'll see here:
  - <img src="images/logos/usdc-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> USD Coin ([USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/)) <br clear='all'>
  - <img src="images/logos/usdt-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Tether ([USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/)) <br clear='all'>
  - <img src="images/logos/dai-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> DAI ([DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/)) <br clear='all'>
    - We've seen DAI before: it's a token cryptocurrency



## Review: Types of currencies
- Commodity currency: made from actual valuable commodities, such as gold
- Representative currency: one that is backed up by a valuable "thing", such as gold
- Fiat currency: established by the government "by fiat"
  - What the US dollar is (now)
- Cryptocurrency (obviously)



## Stablecoin categories
- Fiat-collateralized
  - Rely on a centralized institution with reserves
  - Examples: Tether, USD Coin, TrueUSD
- Crypto-collateralized
  - Use cryptocurrency assets as collateral
  - Examples: Dai (DAI) & Maker (MKR); Havven (HAV) & nUSD, Bitshares (BTS) BitUSD
- Algorithmic non-collateralized
  - Use software-based economic models to maintain stability
  - Examples: Basis, Kowala, Carbon, Fragments
- Hybrid stablecoins
  - A blend of the above approaches
  - Examples: Reserve, Saga, Aurora - Boreal

## Collateralized centralized
- Defining characteristics:
  1. A single entity manages the coin
     - The entity could be a bank, company, non-profit, consortium, etc.
  2. When coins are purchased, the fiat money used for the purchase goes somewhere it can be retrieved
     - Investments, equities, bank account, safe, etc.



<h2><img src="images/logos/usdc-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogoheader"> USD Coin (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/">USDC</a>) <br clear='all'></h2>

- Managed by a consortium named Centre, which is founded by Coinbase (and others)
- Backed by actual monetary investments in various accounts
  - An accounting agency (Grant Thornton) attests monthly to these deposits
- If you buy one, the money you pay goes into these accounts
- But how risky are those deposits?
  - If their value goes down, the number of USDC does not change!
- Not backed by the US government in any way!



<h2><img src="images/logos/usdt-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogoheader"> Tether (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/">USDT</a>) <br clear='all'></h2>

- Similar to USDC in how it works
- Run by Tether Ltd
- As per [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/), it's has the 3rd largest market capitalization (`$`83 billion as of 5/1/22) 
  - After Bitcoin (`$`734 billion) and Ethereum (`$`340 billion)
  - USD Coin is 5th at `$`49 billion
- Scandal-ridden
  - 2019: NY AG accuses Tether of hiding a `$`850 million loss
  - It's really unclear where their reserves are held
  - Many accusations that their reserves are much less than the 1:1 ratio they claim
- Not backed by the US government in any way!



## Tether Scandals



## Disadvantages
- Risky investments

# Uncollateralized centralized

<img src="images/logos/xpd-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogosubtitle">
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea>
## Uncollateralized centralized
- Because it is *centralized*, it is managed by a single entity
- Because it is *uncollateralized*, it is basically the cryptocurrency equivalent of a fiat currency
- Only a government could issue a fiat cryptocurrency and have anybody consider it to have value
- Thus, these would be a national central bank issued cryptocurrency



## Examples
- In the US: none
- <img src="images/flags/uae.svg" class="flag"> UAE: Dubai issues Emcash (launched in 2017) <br clear='all'>
- <img src="images/flags/venezuela.svg" class="flag"> Venezuela: Petro (launched in Feb 2018) <br clear='all'>
  - <img src="images/logos/xpd-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Petro ([XPD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/petrodollar/)) is the only one here [listed on coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/petrodollar/) <br clear='all'>
- <img src="images/flags/estonia.svg" class="flag"> Estonia: Estcoin (planned in 2018, not launched) <br clear='all'>
- <img src="images/flags/russia.svg" class="flag"> Russia: Cryptoruble (still in development) <br clear='all'>
- <img src="images/flags/sweden.svg" class="flag"> Sweden: E-Krona (still in development, launch in 2022?) <br clear='all'>
- <img src="images/flags/japan.svg" class="flag"> Japan: J-Coin (not actually a cryptocurrency, more like a bank account / credit card combination) <br clear='all'>




## Drawbacks 
- The government can track this
- Many people who get into cryptocurrency do not want government centralization
- It's unclear how this would be better than, say, a credit card or a debit card

<h2><img src="images/logos/dai-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogoheader"> Dai (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/">DAI</a>) <br clear='all'></h2>

- Originally only backed by ETH, created in 2017
  - An Ethereum smart contract
  - This coin was <img src="../slides/images/logos/sai-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> SAI (or Single-Collateral DAI)
- In 2019, <img src="../slides/images/logos/dai-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> DAI was created, and is pegged at `$`1 USD
  - An ERC-20 token cryptocurrency we've [talked about before](tokens.html#/dai)
  - All SAI was upgraded to DAI; SAI no longer exists
  - DAI is backed by multiple types of collateral
- <img src="../slides/images/logos/mkr-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> Maker ([MKR](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/maker/)) is the governance token
  - [MakerDAO white paper](https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/)
  - The MakerDAO votes to allow additional types of ERC-20 collateral (and their risk factor)
- Source code for [SAI](https://github.com/makerdao/sai) and [DAI](https://github.com/makerdao/dss)



## How to buy DAI
- Create a 'vault' in a smart contract that contains the asset you want to convert to DAI
  - This vault is the collateral; one asset per vault
- Via the MakerDAO contract, one 'locks' the vault and receives DAI in return
  - Anybody with a vault can do this; you don't need MKR
  - Only the MakerDAO can lock and unlock the vault
  - This DAI is the 'debt' -- hence *Collateralized Debt Position (CDP)*
- To redeem (some or all of) the original assets:
  - Pay back the DAI generated above
  - Pay a 'stability fee' (aka interest) on the DAI generated
  - Withdraw the asset(s) from the vault



## Current DAI stats
- See them at https://daistats.com/
  - On the 'Collateral' tab the stability fees are listed
    - It varies by asset, typically 2%-6%, but can be higher or lower
  - ETH-? provides different levels of risk and reward; see [here](https://forum.defisaver.com/t/converting-between-eth-a-eth-b-and-eth-c-maker-vault-types-using-the-loan-shifter/39) for details
  - The "Collat. Ratio" is how much DAI has been minted versus the collateral
    - Above 100% means more collateral is locked than DAI is issued



## Target Rate Feedback Mechanism (TRFM)
- The target price (aka peg) for DAI is `$`1 USD
- If DAI's price falls below the peg, then there is too much supply (or too little demand)
  - Stabilization goal: reduce supply and increase demand
  - The smart contract automatically increases the target rate(s)
  - DAI is now more expensive to mint
    - This decreases supply (fewer DAI for the same collateral)
    - This increases price (DAI are worth more collateral)
- If DAI's price rises above the peg, then there is too little supply (too much demand)
  - The smart contract decreases the target rate(s)
  - The reverse of the above happens



## DAI Liquidation
- [Liquidation](https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/#liquidation-of-risky-maker-vaults) is discussed in the [DAI whitepaper](https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper)
  - Each asset type has a liquidation ratio
    - Determined and adjusted by MakerDAO votes)
  - If the collateral-to-debt ratio 
- [Here](https://itovault.com/how-dai-liquidation-work-makerdaos-mcd-system/) is how it works ([direct image link](https://itovault.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MakerDAO-Liquidation-1024x916.png))
- See recently [liquidated assets](https://makerburn.com/#/liquidations)
- MKR is minted to make up the shortfall
  - This dilutes the MKR price
  - But since it's worth so much, there is typically no shortfall
  - And it' doesn't happen often
- Read more about liquidations [here](https://itovault.com/how-dai-liquidation-work-makerdaos-mcd-system/)



## What keeps DAI's peg stable?
- Stability fees: these fees build additional collateral in the smart contract
- Liquidation if a vault's assets are too low
  - And minting MKR to make up for any difference in bankrupt vaults
- Target Rate Feedback Mechanism



## SAI / DAI stability
- How well does it work?
  - Coefficient of Variation (CV) is the standard deviation divided by the mean
    - It describes the variability of a sample relative to the average
    - Usually expressed as a percentage
  - For <img src="images/logos/sai-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> SAI, it's 1.33% <br clear='all'>
  - For <img src="images/logos/dai-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> DAI, it's 0.92% <br clear='all'>
  - For <img src="images/logos/eth-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> ETH, it's 147.9% <br clear='all'>
- We can also see it as a graph...
  - I included SAI data until the end of 2019; DAI was introduced Nov 19, 2019; it's price has fluctuated quite a lot since then

## Alias
- As per [Stanford's CS 251 slide set](https://cs251.stanford.edu/lectures/lecture9.pdf), the two categories are:
  - Undercollateralized stablecoins: FRAX, FEI, IRON, OHM, Gyroscope
    - backing: diversified portfolio, seigniorage shares as backstop; peg mechanism: redemption; risks: market risks, oracle dependency
    - <img src="../slides/images/logos/fei-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> of those, [FEI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fei-usd/) has the highest market capitalization (#100 as of 5-23-22) <br clear='all'>
      - <img src="../slides/images/logos/tribe-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> it's governance token is [TRIBE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tribe/) <br clear='all'>
  - Seigniorage shares: Basis, Maker (backstop), Undercollateralized stablecoins (backstop)
    - backing: confidence; peg mechanism: supply expansion and contraction; risks: death spiral, oracle dependency

# Oracles
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea>
## Oracles
- A smart contract can only use the data on the blockchain
- Complex situations require more data than that:
  - Current exchange rates
  - Random numbers
  - The ability to interact with other blockchains
- The solution: Oracles

> Oracle (n): a person who delivers authoritative, wise, or highly regarded and influential pronouncements



## Oracles
We can easily create an oracle:

```
contract Oracle {
    address oracle;
    uint public price;

    constructor() {
        oracle = msg.sender;
    }

    function updatePrice (uint update) external {
        require (msg.sender == oracle, 
                 "Only the Oracle can update this");
        price = update;
    }
}
```
- Getting people to trust it is another matter



## Oracle: trusted signer
![](images/stablecoins/oracles/oracles.dot.1.svg)
- The oracle signer (aka deployer) updates the price, and anybody can read it
  - This works well when the source is centralized
  - Such as the oracles on Ethereum that interact with the Polkadot or Polygon chains
- But a corrupt signer can maliciously manipulate the price



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## Oracle: $m$ of $n$ signers
![](images/stablecoins/oracles/oracles.dot.2.svg)
- So we have multiple signers
- We expect some variance in the values
  - Different exchanges will provide slightly different exchange rates
- We have to take the *median* value, not the *mean*
  - We'll see why next



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## Oracle: $m$ of $n$ signers
![](images/stablecoins/oracles/oracles.dot.3.svg)
- What if some nodes are corrupted?
- We have to take the *median* value, not the *mean*
  - Here the mean is `$`71
  - The median is `$`101
- If more than half are trustworthy, then the oracle will have a correct price
  - Less than half can be traitors!



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## Oracle: Schelling oracles
![](images/stablecoins/oracles/oracles.dot.4.svg)
- Each signer puts a *stake* in their vote
- We accept the value that has the most stake
- Traitors have their stake *slahsed*
  - Although we allow for some variance in the price
  - But if we allow for too much variance, a traitor can just give a valid, but low, price



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## Schelling oracles & whales
![](images/stablecoins/oracles/oracles.dot.5.svg)
- A *whale* could put in a huge stake to manipulate the price
  - Knowing full well s/he will lose their stake
  - Presumably so s/he can make a (bigger) profit off of the price difference

## Terra, LUNAC, and USTC
- Terra is the ecosystem, built upon the Cosmos SDK
  - Company is called Terraform Labs
  - Allows developers to build custom blockchains for decentralized apps
- <img src="images/logos/luna-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> LUNA Classic ([LUNAC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna/)) is the (volatile) cryptocurrency <br clear='all'>
  - Previously just LUNA; had a high of `$`118.74 on April 5, 2022
  - Terra versus LUNAC is like the difference between Ethereum and ETH
- <img src="images/logos/ust-coin-symbol.svg" class="cclogo"> USD Terra Classic ([USTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terrausd/)) (previously just UST) was the stablecoin pegged at `$`1 USD <br clear='all'>
  - The LUNAC cryptocurrency was used to keep the USTC stablecoin on its peg



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## Do Kwon

<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/3150/2*OV9xggK69sh-NyLubhRc1Q.jpeg'>

- Kwon Do-hyung, known as Do Kwon, is the founder of Terraform Labs (along with Daniel Shin)
- Stanford graduate, Korean national
- Founded Terraform Labs in Singapore
- Was on CoinDesk's [2021 Most Influential list](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/10/most-influential-2021-do-kwon/)
- Now widely reviled, and various legal actions are pending against him



## LUNA / UST debacle

- [Article on LUNA / UST background](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-luna-and-ust-a-guide-to-the-terra-ecosystem/)
- [Overview of the crash](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/terras-luna-crypto-crash-how-ust-broke-and-whats-next/)
- [Do Kwon reportedly cashed out $2.7 billion in the span of a few months prior to the LUNA/UST collapse](https://watcher.guru/news/how-do-kwon-allegedly-cashed-out-2-7b-from-terra-network?c=70) (and [twitter announcement](https://twitter.com/watcherguru/status/1535707516784476163?s=21&t=cZ9G69kuatTgBDdnliEieQ)); [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/v9ypa6/heres_how_do_kwon_cashed_out_27_billion_using/) describes the article also
