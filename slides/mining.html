## Disclaimer
- All the numbers shown here were accurate and current as of the time this slide set was written
  - But they are likely all different now
- However, they are (generally) consistent throughout the slide set
  - And the exact numbers don't matter as much to explain the concepts



## Why a higher difficulty?
- As more people mine -- to get the reward -- the time between blocks decreases
  - Each coin is designed to have a fixed time between blocks
  - Bitcoin: 10 minutes; Ravencoin: 1 minute; Ethereum: 12 seconds
- Mining too fast will exhaust the available coin and and devalue the coin's value



## How to make it more difficult
- Force the hash of the mined block to have a certain number of leading zeros
- In [Ravencoin block 1,982,745](https://rvnblockexplorer.com/block/1982745):  0000000000004086a8bfcf0a58beb655 039ae52cedcb46d06de147ea0daa5a76
    - 12 leading hex zeros, 49 leading binary zeros
- In [Bitcoin block 706,020](https://bitcoinblockexplorers.com/block/706020): 000000000000000000021ec74d219d6d 8857f5408bf09314bd20cbebb71c8d93
    - 19 leading hex zeros, 78 leading binary zeros
	- But that was more than the required target; only 76 leading binary zeros were needed



## Random nonces
- Consider a random nonce to generate a hash value
- You would expect that half (50%) would have a leading 0 bit, and the other half would have a leading 1 bit
  - Expectation is that 1/4 (25%) have two leading 0 bits
  - Expectation is that 1/8 (12.5%) have three leading 0 bits
- Expectation is that $1/2^n$ have $n$ leading 0 bits
- Thus:
  - $\frac{1}{2^{49}} = \frac{1}{562,949,953,421,312}$, which is 1 in 562.9 trillion ($10^{12}$), would have 49 leading 0 bits
     - The RVN block example from the last slide
  - $\frac{1}{2^{76}} = \frac{1}{75,557,863,725,914,323,419,136}$, which is 1 in 75.6 sextillion ($10^{21}$), would have 76 leading 0 bits
     - The BTC block example from the last slide



## Bitcoin nonces
- Consider [The Mystery Of The Bitcoin Nonce Pattern](https://blog.bitmex.com/the-mystery-of-the-bitcoin-nonce-pattern/)
- and the first answer [here](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/36860/bitcoin-and-other-crypto-coins-nonce-loop)



## Is that BTC number correct?
- [This site](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate) estimates that the current world-wide BTC hash rate is 147.578 million Th/s
  - Or $147.6 * 10^{18}$ h/s $= 1.476 * 10^{20}$ h/s $= 147.6$ Eh/s
- A 10 minute BTC block takes 600 seconds
  - Or about $88.6$ Zh $= 88.6 * 10^{21}$ h
- We computed 75.6 Zh
- That's close enough for government work!
- The differences were caused by:
  - A decreasing block time caused by more miners; the difficulty will adjust in a week or so
  - The numbers being used coming from different sites and slightly different points in time



## Computing network hash rate
- We can compute this the other way
- Consider a Bitcoin that requres 76 leading zero bits (from 2 slides ago)
  - So we have a 1 in $2^{76}$ or 1 in $75.6*10^{21}$ chance to get a hash
  - Rephrased: we would expect to get valid nonce after $75.6*10^{21}$ hashes
- Bitcoin is designed to have 10 minutes per block (600s)
- Dividing one by the other yields 126 Eh/s
  - Close enough to 147.578 for a rough estimate!
- This can be done with any coin when you know the difficulty and block rate



## When will you get a RVN block?
- Assume that your graphics card's GPU can compute about 50 Mh/s for kawpow (RVN) ([source](https://2cryptocalc.com/gpu/24h/3090/1))
  - That's a *very* fast graphics card (Nvidia 3090)
- We expect to get a block after $562.9 * 10^{12}$ hashes (or 562.9 Th)
- A 52 Mh/s graphics card will compute 562.9 Th in about 130 days
- Reward is 5000 RVN (2,500 after the halving in Jan 2022) times 11&cent; per RVN = $550
  - Or $4.23 per day, on average
  - Minus electrical costs of about 85&cent; per day yields about a $3.50 / day profit



## When will you get a BTC block?
- Assume that your graphics card's GPU can compute about 9,700 Mh/s for SHA-256 (BTC) ([source](https://gist.github.com/Chick3nman/e4fcee00cb6d82874dace72106d73fef))
  - Again, that's a *very* fast graphics card (Nvidia 3090)
- We expect to get a block after $75.6 * 10^{21}$ hashes (or 75.6 Zh)
- A 9,700 Mh/s graphics card will compute 75.6 Zh in about 90,206,185 days (246,971 years!)
- Reward is <span id='btc_reward_btc'>(undefined)</span> BTC times $<span id='btc_price'>(undefined)</span> per BTC
  - Which is $<span id='btc_reward_usd'>(undefined)</span> per mined block
  - Or $1.64 per *year*, on average
  - Minus electrical costs...



## When will you get a BTC block with an ASIC?
- Consider the [Avalon 1166 miner](https://canaan.io/product/a1166pro-s-75t), as one example, that can compute $75$ Th/s $= 75 * 10^{12}$ h/s
- We expect to get a block after $75.6 * 10^{21}$ hashes (or 75.6 Zh)
- A 75 Th/s ASIC will compute 75.6 Zh in about 11,666 days (32 years)
- Reward is 6.25 BTC times $65,000 per BTC
  - Which is $406,250 per mined block
  - Or about $12,720 (0.20 BTC) per *year*
  - Minus electrical costs...



## Is an ASIC miner worth it?
- Again, consider the [Avalon 1166 miner](https://canaan.io/product/a1166pro-s-75t)
- It generates $12,720 per year, and uses 3,420 W of electricity
  - That's 82 kWh / day
  - At 11.04&cent; per kWh, that's about $9 per day
  - Or about $270 per month
  - Or about $3,300 per year, on average
- So the profit is really only $9,420 per year
- At a cost of about $5k, it will pay itself off in about 6 months
  - Well, maybe...



## Is an ASIC miner worth it?
- It will generate a lot of money UNLESS...
  - The overall hash rate goes up significantly
    - That miner is then producing a lower percentage of the overall hash rate
    - And everybody and their siblings are getting into mining these days...
  - The price of BTC goes down
  - Electricity costs rise
  - The miner doesn't actually produce the stated hash rate
  - The miner breaks -- how will you get it fixed?



## Is CPU mining worth it for Bitcoin?
- Assume that your CPU can compute about 65 K hashes per second ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4764026/how-many-sha256-hashes-can-a-modern-computer-compute))
  - That's 65 *K* hashes or about 65,000 hashes
- We expect to get a block after $75.6 * 10^{21}$ hashes (or 75.6 Zh)
- A 65 K CPU will compute 75.6 Zh in about 878,117,316,473 (878 billion) days
  - That's 2,404,154,186 (2.4 billion) years
- You still have to factor in electrical costs!
- And even if this is off by a factor of 1,000, it's still way to slow



## Mining: nbits
- The nbits field is a 8-digit (32-bit) hex number, such as:  0x1b00a908
  - It's like an enocded floating point number
- The first 2 digits (1b) is the *exponent*; convert to decimal and subtract 3
  - $0x1b -3 = 27-3=24$
  - This means there will be <span class="skyblue">24 *trailing* 0x00 bytes</span> (48 zero hex digits)
- The last 6 digits of the nbits are the <span class="lightgreen">*mantissa:* 0x00a908</span>
- We left-fill with 0's to 256 bits (64 hex digits)
  - With 48 trailing zero digits and 6 exponent digits, that leaves us <span class="pink">10 leading 0x0 hex digits</span> (5 0x00 bytes)
- This gets us: 0x<span class="pink">0000000000</span><span class="lightgreen">00a908</span><span class="skyblue">00000000000000000 0000000000000000000000000000000</span>



## Mining: nbits & target
- An nbits field of 0x1b00a908 thus gets us a *target* of 0x000000000000a908000000000000000 000000000000000000000000000000000
  - This is from [RVN block 1,982,364](https://rvnblockexplorer.com/block/1982364)
  - The hash value had to be less than that
- That target requires 12 leading zero hex digits (48 leading binary zero bits)
    - Chance to find: $1/2^{48}$
- The first RVN target ([RVN block 1](https://rvnblockexplorer.com/block/1)) was 0x1d00ffff = 0x00000000ffff0000000000000000000000 000000000000000000000000000000
  - Note that some report it as 0x1e00fff; we'll use 0x1d00ffff



## Mining: targets & difficulty
- If you divide the current target by the original target, you get the difficulty
  - How many times harder the current block is than the original block
- For [RVN block 1,982,364](https://rvnblockexplorer.com/block/1982364), that's about 99,253.60
- To avoid confusion, I will refer to this as *network difficulty*
- You can see the current [RVN network difficulty](https://2miners.com/rvn-network-difficulty)
  - And also the current [BTC network difficulty](https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/difficulty-chart)
- [This page at the Bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty) describes difficulty computation in more detail (and provides C++ code)



## bdiff versus pdiff
- The first RVN & BTC target was 0x1d00ffff = 0x00000000ffff0000000000000000000000 000000000000000000000000000000
  - This is the exact expansion of the *nbits* value
  - That yields a difficulty of 99,253.59955
  - This is *bdiff* (think: bitcoin-diff)
- Traditionally it was represented as a target of 0x00000000ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
  - This is a "non-truncated target", and usually the values used by mining pools
  - That yields a difficulty of 99,255.11406
  - This is *pdiff* (think: pool-diff)



## Miner reported difficulty
- A mining program will report the difficulty of a *share*
  - For now, a *share* is a nonce found that has a lot of leading 0's, even if it is not enough to solve the block
  - "134.25 T", for example
  - I'll refer to this as the *share difficulty* to avoid confusion
- If the share had 42 leading zero bits, then it would report a share difficulty of $2^{42} = 4.4$ T
  - 44 leading zero bits yields a share difficulty of $17.6$ T
  - The target for [RVN block 1,982,364](https://rvnblockexplorer.com/block/1982364) needed 48 leading zero bits, so that required a share of about 281.5 T or higher



## Miner reported difficulty
- Given *nbits* of 0x1b00a908 for [RVN block 1,982,364](https://rvnblockexplorer.com/block/1982364), we can compute $b$, the exact number of zero bits needed, via:
  - Let $m$ be the (base-10) value of the mantissa
    - $m=0x00a908=43,272$
  - Let $p$ be the number of hex bytes (not digits) from the power part of *nbits*; this is the power value
    - $p=0x1b-3=27-3=24$
  - Let $l_h$ be the leading number of 0 hex digits (not bytes) in the target
    - $l_h=64-6-2*p=10$
  - The exact number of zero bits, $b$, needed is then:
    - $b=4*l_h+24-log2(m) = 48.59885$
- The minimum required share difficulty, $sd$, is then 2 to that power: $sd=2^b=2^{48.59885} = 426.30$ T



## Miner reported difficulty
- Another way to look at it:
  - Let $nd$ be the network difficulty (say, 113k)
  - Let $od$ be the original difficulty of block 1 ($2^{32}=4.29G$)
- The current difficulty, $cd$, is just the product of those two: $cd = nd * od$
    - For [RVN block 1,982,364](https://rvnblockexplorer.com/block/1982364), the network difficulty was 100.3417k
        - (RVN historical difficulty can be found [here](https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/ravencoin/difficulty-chart)
    - Making the total difficulty then be: $100k * 4.3G = 4.29T$
        - Which is quite close to our estimate of 426.3 from the last slide



## Mining pools
- The chance of you getting a Bitcoin block is really low
- But if you team up with other people, you can all contribute, and if the group gets a block the reward is distributed among the members
- This is a *mining pool*
- For Proof-of-Work (PoW) coins, members get a percentage of the value of the pooled profit based on the amount of work they put in
- But how to compute that?



## Mining shares
- Any *good* nonce is reported to the mining pool, even if it is not enough to solve the block
  - Consider the [2miners RVN mining pool](https://rvn.2miners.com/), which has *ldiff* (pool mining difficulty) of 4.295 G
  - So any nonce found that has a difficulty of $4.295$ G$ = 4.295 * 10^9$ or higher will be reported to the mining pool
- It is thus expexcted to take $log_2(4.295G) = 2^{32}$ hashes to get a share
  - So a 50 Mh/s GPU (the Nvidia 3090) would expect to get a share every 85.9 seconds
- The *ldiff* value keeps the bandwidth to the mining pool down while also allowing an estimate of the work performed



## Miner reported difficulty
- The nonce found for [RVN block 1,982,364](https://rvnblockexplorer.com/block/1982364) generated a hash of 0x0000000000003d7678380e2f25b4a8c 8271b53638d380f761acbf4ee040f325a; what was its share difficulty?
- Let $l_b$ be the leading number of binary bits in the hash (note that $l_h = l_b*4$):
  - $l_b = 256 - log_2(hash) = 50.05835$
- The difficulty with $l_b$ bits is just 
  - $2^{l_b} = 2^{50.05835} = 1.1724*10^{15} = 1,172.4$ T
  - But the number reported by the mining software was $541.1$ T, so something is off here...



## To add in this column...

# Environmental Issues
	  </textarea></section>

  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea>
## How much is mining killing the Earth?
- Again, consider the [Avalon 1166 miner](https://canaan.io/product/a1166pro-s-75t)
  - It uses 3,420 W and produces 75 Th/s
  - That's 21.9 Gh/W, which is pretty efficient (relatively speaking)
  - 3,420 W for 24 hours/day yields 82.08 kWh
  - At Charlottesville's electric rates (11.04&cent; per kWh) that's $9.06 per day
- [This site](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate) estimates that the current world-wide BTC hash rate is 147.578 million Th/s
  - If it were only Avalon 1166 miners, then we need 1,967,706 such miners, at 75 Th/s, to get 147.578 million Th/s
  - That's 6.73 GW ($10^{12}$W), or 161.5 GWh per day, or 58,991 GWh per year



## Death to the Environment!
- The lower-bound estimate from the last slide is that BTC mining uses 6.73 GW ($10^{12}$W), or 161.5 GWh per day, or 58,991 GWh per year
- That is more than 170 of the world's 218 countries ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption))
- That is the equivalent to 15% of the total US electrical usage per year ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption))



## Death to the Environment!
- These computations:
  - Assume that all the BTC mining is as efficient as the Avalon 1166 miner
  - Do not factor in the other mined coins
- So perhaps the actual amount is twice our initial estimate?
  - That is the equivalent to 30% of the total US electrical usage per year ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption))



## Actual usage
- 0.08% of worldwide electricity usage as per [here](https://decrypt.co/91824/bitcoin-mining-carbon-emissions-inconsequential-levels-coinshares)
- take it with a grain of salt: crypto companies saying it's fine for the env is like a cigarette company saying smoking is not unhealthy



## What about GPU mining?
- Consider Ravencoin
  - Total network hashrate of 8 Th/s ([source](https://2miners.com/rvn-network-hashrate))
  - A Nvidia 3090 computes about 50 Mh/s and consumes about 350 W for about 143 kh/W
  - And that card is much more efficient
- That would be 160,000 such GPUs
  - Or 56 mW
  - But probably higher due to other GPUs not being as efficient

## Mining
- In order for mining to occur, there has to be a way for some entity to mine a block
- But how to decide who gets to mine it?
  - Since there is a reward involved, everybody wants to be that one entity!



## Proof of Work (PoW)
- This is what we've seen so far:
  - Find a nonce (and transaction order) to get the hash less than the target
- The successful miner has shown s/he has done the work...
  - ... or just been lucky enough...
- ... to "complete" the block



## Proof of Work (PoW) issues
- High energy usage
  - Environmental issues as a result
  - It's not a "green" solution by any means
- Can cause bottlenecks when there is a lot of activity
  - Not a problem for Bitcoin
  - Bit it's a problem for DeFi that runs on top of Ethereum



## "Useful" Proof-of-Work (PoW)
- Use computing power for some "good"
- Example: Primecoin
  - https://primecoin.io/bin/primecoin-paper.pdf



## ASIC mining
- Some cryptocurrencies use hash algorithms that special-purpose hardware can mine
  - ASIC = application-specific integrated circuit
  - Bitcoin, Ethereum (before the ETH2 upgrade)



## ASIC-resistant mining
- Consider Ravencoin, which aims for ASIC-resistant mining
- It uses 16 different hash algorithms
  - The last 8 bytes of the previous block's hash determine which 8 algorithms to use
  - That's a *LOT* of hashes, and it is very power-intensive
- Many are skeptical of it's ASIC-resistance
  - If it were valuable enough, I'm sure somebody would develop an ASIC for it
- The developers regularly update the algorithm to try to maintain ASIC-resistance
  - Original algorithm was [x16r](https://ravencoin.org/assets/documents/X16R-Whitepaper.pdf), then x16rv2, and now kawpow



## Proof of Stake (PoS)
- Those with a *stake* in the cryptocurrency...
  - ... meaning they hold enough of it...
- Can be the ones to present a mined block to the network
  - They put their cryptocurrency "on the line" to vouch for the validity of the block
  - And they get the miner reward
- But what if the block is invalid?
  - Then the miner loses some of his cryptocurrency
    - Called "slashing"
  - While not unknown, it rarely happens
- Miners are instead called *validators*



## Proof of Stake (PoS)
- The network chooses the validators based on:
  - Amount of currency held
  - Length of currency held
- Implementations vary by cryptocurrency
  - Presumably there is a way that those with less "stake" will be able to be the validators less often
- Coins that use this: Tezos, Cosmos, Peercoin, Tendermint, the ETH2 upgrade
  - ETH2 requires a minimum of 32 ETH to participate in PoS



## Peercoin
- See http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~austin/cs168-fall20/slides/CS168-Day16-AlternateProofSchemes.pdf (last few slides)



## Tendermint
- See http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~austin/cs168-fall20/slides/CS168-Day17-Tendermint.pdf



## Proof of Stake problems
- Nothing-at-stake-problem
- See http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~austin/cs168-fall20/slides/CS168-Day16-AlternateProofSchemes.pdf slide 14



## Staking
- Let's say you wanted to be a validator for a PoS coin
- If you had more of that coin...
   - ... you could be "chosen" as the validator more often
   - ... and thus get more of the validator reward
- So you might "rent" coins from others to increase your balance



## Staking
- If you have some of a coin, you could "loan" it to others so they can better participate in PoS
  - This is called "staking"
- Advantages:
  - You get a payout: maybe 5% of your "loan" per year
- Disadvantages:
  - You can't get your "stake" back early
- A good choice if you definitely are not going to sell in the near future



## Staking Legality
- On Feb 3, 2022, the IRS said it will not tax unsold, staked crypto ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kamranrosen/2022/02/02/in-huge-precedent-irs-says-it-will-not-tax-unsold-staked-crypto/?sh=135dbc5f464c))
  - You still pay when you sell it, of course
- Such coins are "new property" not "income"
- Once sold, presumably you would pay taxes on it similar to how you pay taxes on interest
  - But that was not mentioned in that article...



## ETH2
- aka Casper Protocol
- the 'timebomb' in ETH
- what the switch will mean
- when it will happen



## Proof-of-Capacity
- aka Proof-of-Storage
- See https://www.publish0x.com/knowledge-for-cryptocurrency-users/four-proof-of-capacity-coins-xyyypo
- Example: Permacoin



## Proof-of-replication (PoRep)
- Filecoin: https://filecoin.io
- See https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-replication



## Proof-of-spacetime
- ???
- maybe info at http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~austin/cs168-fall20/greensheet.html



## "Green" coins
- See https://investorplace.com/2021/05/green-coins-5-of-the-most-eco-friendly-cryptos-elon-musk-should-consider-now/
- Sometimes called "greencoins", but there also a [Greencoin (GRE) cyrptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/greencoin/)
- See https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/eco-friendly-cryptocurrencies/
- talk about Stellar Lumens (XLM), which uses "trusted" nodes rather than proof-of-X

## Consider...
- The first few blocks of an arbitrary cryptocurrency...
- Here is the genesis block:

<img src="images/mining/dag/dag.dot.1.svg">



## The first block mined
<img src="images/mining/dag/dag.dot.2.svg">
Block 0 is on the top, block 1 is on the bottom



## Two blocks mined
<img src="images/mining/dag/dag.dot.3.svg">
We've just mined block 2



## A transaction

Note that UTXOs are not only in the bottom level

## Realism
- Most (all?) cryptocurrencies are mined by the developers for the first many blocks
  - Ethereum's first transaction was in block [46,147](https://etherscan.io/block/46147)
  - Bitcoin only had a few hundred accounts in the first 50,000 (or so) transactions
- But the previous images of the DAG still show the concepts of having many transactions



## DAGs
- The entire transaction list is a directed acyclic graph
  - aka DAG
- In order to successfully mine, this has to be kept in memory
  - as that tells you if a UTXO has already been spent or not
- Optimization: use hash tables (or similar)
  - Map a UTXO to the amount it makes available
  - And only keep track of the unspent UTXOs
- So not *really* a DAG, then...



## DAG size
- You can see DAG sizes at https://minerstat.com/dag-size-calculator
- Ethereum is over 4 Gb (as of Feb 2022)
  - This means that graphics cards with less than 4 Gb cannot mine ETH
- Consider Ravencoin, whose DAG is currently at 3.2 Gb (as of Feb 2022)
  - Based on the expected DAG growth...
    - 4 Gb GPUS will no longer be able to mine it around July 2023
    - 6 Gb GPUS will no longer be able to mine it around Mar 2027
