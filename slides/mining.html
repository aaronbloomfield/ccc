## Disclaimer
- All the numbers shown here were accurate and current as of the time this slide set was updated
  - September 13, 2022  <!-- change each semester -->
    - Specifically, before Ethereum went to PoS (and all their hash power went elsewhere)
  - But they are likely all different now
- However, they are (generally) consistent throughout the slide set
  - And the exact numbers don't matter as much to explain the concepts



<!-- .slide: class="cclogo-slide" -->
## Coins we'll study
- [![btc logo](../slides/images/logos/btc-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)
 Bitcoin: we all know this <br clear='all'>
  - Hash algorithm: double SHA-256
- [![rvn logo](../slides/images/logos/rvn-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ravencoin/)
 Ravencoin <br clear='all'>
  - A fork of Bitcoin, so works similarily; focuses on tokens
  - Designed to be ASIC resistant
  - Hash algorithm: kawpow (16 different rotating algorithms)
- [![eth logo](../slides/images/logos/eth-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)
 Ethereum <br clear='all'>
  - A generational improvement over Bitcoin
  - Allows for much more complicated programs
  - Hash algorithm: Keccak-256 (aka SHA3)
  - It just moved to proof-of-stake



## Why a higher difficulty?
- As more people mine -- to get the reward -- the time between blocks decreases
  - Each coin is designed to have a fixed time between blocks
  - Bitcoin: 10 minutes; Ravencoin: 1 minute; Ethereum: (previously) 12-15 seconds
- Mining too fast will exhaust the available coin and and devalue the coin's value



## How to make it more difficult
- Force the hash of the mined block to have a certain number of leading zeros
- In [Ravencoin block 2,150,108](https://rvnblockexplorer.com/block/2150108):  000000000000e1c48b 11f28eaf2cc6e60d345aa4b3cfe12747c0821ff14f6279
    - 12 leading hex zeros, 48 leading bits
- In [Bitcoin block 753,940](https://bitcoinblockexplorers.com/block/753940):  000000000000000000 055edf99acd7c1ec25b4020994e865eccd0f00cbcc5662 <!-- change each semester -->
    - 19 leading hex zeros, 77 leading bits



## Random nonces
- Consider a random nonce to generate a hash value
- You would expect that half (50%) would have a leading 0 bit, and the other half would have a leading 1 bit
  - Expectation is that 1/4 (25%) have two leading 0 bits
  - Expectation is that 1/8 (12.5%) have three leading 0 bits
- Expectation is that $\frac{1}{2}^n$ have $n$ leading 0 bits
- Thus...
<ul>
  <li class='fragment'> RVN example: $\frac{1}{2^{48}}$, which is 1 in 281 trillion ($2.81 \ast 10^{12}$), would have 48 leading 0 bits </li>
  <li class='fragment'> BTC example: $\frac{1}{2^{77}}$, which is 1 in 151 sextillion ($151 \ast 10^{21}$), would have 77 leading 0 bits </li>
</ul>



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## Bitcoin nonces

<a href='https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1081217034485149697'><img src='images/mining/nonce-tweet.webp' style="width:40%;border-radius:10px"></a>

- Consider [The Mystery Of The Bitcoin Nonce Pattern](https://blog.bitmex.com/the-mystery-of-the-bitcoin-nonce-pattern/)
  - And the [full image](images/mining/nonce-tweet-graph.webp) ([remote](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DwFAIi8WoAAyUwq?format=jpg&name=large))
- Early blocks (left-most) were Satoshi experimenting
- Possible reasons:
  - Selection bias ([source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/36860/bitcoin-and-other-crypto-coins-nonce-loop))
  - How ASICs work ([source](https://blog.bitmex.com/the-mystery-of-the-bitcoin-nonce-pattern/))





## Is that BTC number correct?
- [This site](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate) estimates that the current world-wide BTC hash rate is 232 million Th/s <!-- change each semester -->
  - Or $232 * 10^{18}$ h/s $= 2.32 * 10^{20}$ h/s $= 232$ Eh/s
- A 10 minute BTC block takes 600 seconds
  - Or about $140$ Zh $= 1.4 * 10^{23}$ h
- We computed needing 151 Zh (zetta hashes)
  - That's close enough for government work!
- The differences were caused by:
  - A decreasing block time caused by more miners; the difficulty will adjust in a week or so
  - The numbers being used coming from different sites and slightly different points in time



## Computing network hash rate
- We can compute this the other way
- Consider a Bitcoin that requires 77 leading zero bits (from earlier)
  - So we have a 1 in $2^{77}$ or 1 in $151*10^{21}$ chance to get a hash
  - Rephrased: we would expect to get valid nonce after $151*10^{21}$ hashes (or 151 Zh)
- Bitcoin is designed to have 10 minutes per block (600s)
- Dividing one by the other yields 251 Eh/s
  - Again, close enough for an estimate, as it's actually 232 Zh <!-- change each semester -->
- This can be done with any coin when you know the difficulty and block rate



## When will you get a RVN block?
- Assume that your graphics card's GPU can compute about 50 Mh/s for kawpow (RVN) ([source](https://2cryptocalc.com/gpu/24h/3090/1))
  - That's a *very* fast graphics card (Nvidia 3090)
- We expect to get a block after $281 * 10^{12}$ hashes (or 281 Th)
- A 50 Mh/s graphics card will compute 281 Th in about 63 days
- Reward is 2,500 RVN times 7&cent; per RVN = $175
  - Or `$`2.78 per day, on average
  - Minus electrical costs of about 85&cent; per day yields about a `$`1.93 / day profit



## When will you get a BTC block with a GPU?
- Assume that your graphics card's GPU can compute about 9,700 Mh/s for SHA-256 (BTC) ([source](https://gist.github.com/Chick3nman/e4fcee00cb6d82874dace72106d73fef))
  - Again, that's a *very* fast graphics card (Nvidia 3090)
- We expect to get a block after $151 \ast 10^{21}$ hashes (or 151 Zh) <!-- change each semester -->
- A 9,700 Mh/s graphics card will compute 151 Zh in about 180,173,730 days (493,288 years!)
- Reward is 6.25 BTC times `$`22,000 per BTC
  - Which is `$`137,500 per mined block
  - Or `$`0.28 per *year*, on average
  - Minus electrical costs of about `$`1 per day...



## When will you get a BTC block with an ASIC?
- Consider the [Avalon 1166 miner](https://canaan.io/product/a1166pro-s-75t), as one example, that can compute $75$ Th/s $= 75 * 10^{12}$ h/s
- We expect to get a block after $151 * 10^{21}$ hashes (or 151 Zh) <!-- change each semester -->
- A 75 Th/s ASIC will compute 151 Zh in about 23,302 days (63 years)
- Reward is 6.25 BTC times `$`22,000 per BTC
  - Which is `$`137,500 per mined block
  - Or about `$`2,182 (0.10 BTC) per *year*
  - Minus electrical costs...



## Is an ASIC miner worth it?
- Again, consider the [Avalon 1166 miner](https://canaan.io/product/a1166pro-s-75t)
- It generates about `$`2,182 per year, and uses 3,420 W of electricity <!-- change each semester -->
  - That's 82 kWh / day
  - At 11.04&cent; per kWh, that's about $9 per day
  - Or about $270 per month
  - Or about $3,300 per year, on average
- So the profit is a loss of `$`1,100 per year
  - Unless you use somebody else's electricity...
- At a cost of about $4.5k, it will pay itself off in about 2 years
  - But ONLY IF you don't pay for the electricity



## Is an ASIC miner worth it?
- It will generate a money UNLESS...
  - You have to actually pay for the electricity
  - The overall hash rate goes up significantly
    - That miner is then producing a lower percentage of the overall hash rate
    - And everybody and their siblings are getting into mining these days...
  - The price of BTC goes down
  - The miner doesn't actually produce the stated hash rate
  - The miner breaks -- how will you get it fixed?
- If the price of BTC goes up a lot...
  - ...and the hash rate doesn't increase as rapidly
  - Then it might make a profit with electrical costs



## Is CPU mining worth it for Bitcoin?
- Assume that your CPU can compute about 65 K hashes per second ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4764026/how-many-sha256-hashes-can-a-modern-computer-compute))
  - That's 65 *K* hashes or about 65,000 hashes
- We expect to get a block after $120 * 10^{21}$ hashes (or 151 Zh) <!-- change each semester -->
- A 65 K CPU will compute 151 Zh in about 26 *trillion* days
  - That's 74 *billion* years
- You still have to factor in electrical costs!
- And even if this is off by a factor of 1,000, it's still way to slow



## Mining: nbits
- The nbits field is a 8-digit (32-bit) hex number, such as:  0x1b00a908
  - It's like an enocded floating point number
- The first 2 digits (1b) is the *exponent*; convert to decimal and subtract 3
  - $0x1b -3 = 27-3=24$
  - This means there will be <span class="skyblue">24 *trailing* 0x00 bytes</span> (48 zero hex digits)
- The last 6 digits of the nbits are the <span class="lightgreen">*mantissa:* 0x00a908</span>
- We left-fill with 0's to 256 bits (64 hex digits)
  - With 48 trailing zero digits and 6 exponent digits, that leaves us <span class="pink">10 leading 0x0 hex digits</span> (5 0x00 bytes)
- This gets us: 0x<span class="pink">0000000000</span><span class="lightgreen">00a908</span><span class="skyblue">00000000000000000 0000000000000000000000000000000</span>



## Mining: nbits & target
- An nbits field of 0x1b00a908 thus gets us a *target* of 0x000000000000a908000000000000000 000000000000000000000000000000000
  - This is from [RVN block 1,982,364](https://rvnblockexplorer.com/block/1982364)
  - The hash value had to be less than that
- That target requires 12 leading zero hex digits (48 leading binary zero bits)
    - Chance to find: $\approx 1/2^{48}$
- The first RVN target ([RVN block 1](https://rvnblockexplorer.com/block/1)) was 0x1d00ffff = 0x00000000ffff00000000000000000000 00000000000000000000000000000000
  - Chance to find: 1 in $2^{32}$ or 1 in 4.3 billion
  - Note that some incorrectly report it as 0x1e00fff



## Mining: targets & difficulty
- If you divide the current target by the original target, you get the difficulty
  - How many times harder the current block is than the original block
- For [RVN block 1,982,364](https://rvnblockexplorer.com/block/1982364), that's about 99,253.60
- To avoid confusion, I will refer to this as *network difficulty*
- You can see the current [RVN network difficulty](https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/ravencoin/difficulty-chart)
  - And also the current [BTC network difficulty](https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/difficulty-chart)
- [This page at the Bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty) describes difficulty computation in more detail (and provides C++ code)



## Miner reported difficulty
- Another way to look at it:
  - Let $d_n$ be the network difficulty (say, 100k)
  - Let $d_o$ be the original difficulty of block 1 ($2^{32}=4.29G$)
- The current target is as hard as the product of those two: $t = d_n * d_o$
    - For [RVN block 1,982,364](https://rvnblockexplorer.com/block/1982364), the network difficulty was 100.3417k
        - (RVN historical difficulty can be found [here](https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/ravencoin/difficulty-chart))
    - Making the target as hard as $100k * 4.3G = 4.29T$



## bdiff versus pdiff
- The first RVN & BTC target was 0x1d00ffff = 0x00000000ffff0000000000000000000000 000000000000000000000000000000
  - This is the exact expansion of the *nbits* value
  - That yields a difficulty of 99,253.59955
  - This is *bdiff* (think: bitcoin-diff)
- Traditionally it was represented as a target of 0x00000000ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
  - This is a "non-truncated target", and usually the values used by mining pools
  - That yields a difficulty of 99,255.11406
  - This is *pdiff* (think: pool-diff)



## Mining pools
- The chance of you getting a Bitcoin block is really low
- But if you team up with other people, you can all contribute, and if the group gets a block the reward is distributed among the members
- This is a *mining pool*
- For Proof-of-Work (PoW) coins, members get a percentage of the value of the pooled profit based on the amount of work they put in
- But how to compute that?
  - More on that in a bit...



## Miner reported difficulty
- A mining program will report the difficulty of a *share*
  - For now, a *share* is a nonce found that has a lot of leading 0's, even if it is not enough to solve the block
  - "134.25 T", for example
  - I'll refer to this as the *share difficulty*, or $d_s$, to avoid confusion
  - Share difficulty is set by the mining pool
- If a share requires 42 leading zero bits, then it would report a share difficulty of $2^{42} = 4.4$ T
  - 44 leading zero bits yields a share difficulty of $17.6$ T
  - The target for [RVN block 1,982,364](https://rvnblockexplorer.com/block/1982364) needed 48 leading zero bits
    - $s_d=2^{48} = 281.5$ T

<!--
## Miner reported difficulty
- Given *nbits* of 0x1b00a908 for [RVN block 1,982,364](https://rvnblockexplorer.com/block/1982364), we can compute $b$, the exact number of zero bits needed, via:
  - Let $m$ be the (base-10) value of the mantissa
    - $m=0x00a908=43,272$
  - Let $p$ be the number of hex bytes (not digits) from the power part of *nbits*; this is the power value
    - $p=0x1b-3=27-3=24$
  - Let $l_h$ be the leading number of 0 hex digits (not bytes) in the target
    - $l_h=64-6-2*p=10$
  - The exact number of zero bits, $b$, needed is then:
    - $b=4*l_h+24-log2(m) = 48.59885$
- The minimum required share difficulty, $sd$, is then 2 to that power: $sd=2^b=2^{48.59885} = 426.30$ T
-->



## Mining shares
- Any *good* nonce is reported to the mining pool, even if it is not enough to solve the block
  - Consider the [2miners RVN mining pool](https://rvn.2miners.com/), which has *pdiff* (pool mining difficulty) of 4.295 G
  - So any nonce found that has a difficulty of $4.295$ G$ = 4.295 * 10^9$ or higher will be reported to the mining pool
- It is thus expected to take $4.295G = 2^{32}$ hashes to get a share
  - So a 50 Mh/s GPU (the Nvidia 3090) would expect to get a share every 85.9 seconds
- The share value keeps the bandwidth to the mining pool down while also allowing an estimate of the work performed

<!--
## Miner reported difficulty
- The nonce found for [RVN block 1,982,364](https://rvnblockexplorer.com/block/1982364) generated a hash of 0x0000000000003d7678380e2f25b4a8c 8271b53638d380f761acbf4ee040f325a; what was its share difficulty?
- Let $l_b$ be the leading number of binary bits in the hash (note that $l_h = l_b*4$):
  - $l_b = 256 - log_2(hash) = 50.05835$
- The difficulty with $l_b$ bits is just 
  - $2^{l_b} = 2^{50.05835} = 1.1724*10^{15} = 1,172.4$ T
  - But the number reported by the mining software was $541.1$ T, so something is off here...

# Environmental Issues

  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea>
## How much is mining killing the Earth?
- Again, consider the [Avalon 1166 miner](https://canaan.io/product/a1166pro-s-75t)
  - It uses 3,420 W and produces 75 Th/s
  - That's 21.9 Gh/W, which is pretty efficient (relatively speaking)
  - 3,420 W for 24 hours/day yields 82.08 kWh
  - At Charlottesville's electric rates (11.04&cent; per kWh) that's $9.06 per day
- [This site](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate) estimates that the current world-wide BTC hash rate is 200 million Th/s (200 Eh/s)
  - If it were only Avalon 1166 miners, then we need 2,666,666 such miners, at 75 Th/s, to get 200 million Th/s
  - That's 9.2 GW ($10^{12}$W), or 219 GWh per day, or about 80,000 GWh (80 TWh) per year



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## Death to the Environment!

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/AlfedPalmersmokestacks.jpg" style="padding:0">

- The lower-bound estimate from the last slide is that BTC mining uses 9.2 GW ($10^{12}$W), or 219 GWh per day, or 80 TWh per year
  - A [2019 estimate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435119302557) was at 46 TWh per year, but the [hash rate](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate?timespan=all) has tripled since then
- That is more than 171 of the world's 218 countries ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption))
- That is the equivalent to 2% of the total US electrical usage per year ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption))



## Death to the Environment!
- These computations:
  - Assume that all the BTC mining is as efficient as the Avalon 1166 miner
    - To little efficiency and money is lost, not gained
  - Do not factor in the other mined coins
- So perhaps the actual amount is twice our initial estimate?
  - That is the equivalent to 4% of the total US electrical usage per year ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption))
  - That's 160 TWh per year
  - But that's a total guess, though!



## Worldwide power consumption
- In 2019, the world used 23,398 TWh of electricity ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption))
  - The US used 3,990 TWh (17.1% of total)
  - Only China was higher at 8,313 TWh (35.5% of total)
- We guessed that cryptocurrency mining uses 160 TWh per year
- That is 0.7% of the worldwide total energy usage
  - 0.35% for Bitcoin only



## Actual usage
- Consider: [Bitcoin Mining Carbon Emissions at 'Inconsequential' Levels: CoinShares](https://decrypt.co/91824/bitcoin-mining-carbon-emissions-inconsequential-levels-coinshares)
  - They estimate that bitcoin mining uses 0.08% of worldwide electricity
- Take that with a grain of salt, though!
  - A cryptocurrency company, that makes money off of mining, saying it's fine for the environment is like a cigarette company saying smoking is not unhealthy



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## BTC mining in the US
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Texas_flag_map.svg)
- [Texas is the go-to place to mine BTC](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/08/bitcoin-mining-texas-electricity/)
  - Cheap energy and a business-friendly environment
- The miners [turn off the mining when demand spikes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2022/07/15/bitcoin-crypto-texas-heat-wave/)
  - And they [*get paid to do so*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-bitcoin-miners-getting-paid-064946406.html) ([original source](https://fortune.com/2022/07/12/texas-bitcoin-miners-paid-shut-down-power-grid-electricity-blackout-heat/))
  <!-- - The cost of this is pushed off to consumers in other ways: [low social services](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-states-spend-most-least-090000541.html) (6th worst), [low quality of life](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-10-us-states-with-the-worst-quality-of-life.html) (5th worst), [highest overall taxes](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/highest-taxed-states) (7th worst), etc. -->

## Mining
- In order for transactions to occur, there has to be a way for some entity to "certify" a block
  - So far the only certification method we've seen is proof-of-work mining
- But how to decide who gets to do it?
  - Since there is a reward involved, everybody wants to be that one entity!



## Proof of Work (PoW)
- This is what we've seen so far:
  - Find a nonce (and transaction order) to get the hash less than the target
- The successful miner has shown s/he has done the work...
  - ... or just been lucky enough...
- ... to "complete" the block



## Proof of Work (PoW) issues
- High energy usage
  - Environmental issues as a result
  - It's not a "green" solution by any means
- Can cause bottlenecks when there is a lot of activity
  - Not (currently) a problem for Bitcoin
    - It was before witnesses were added, though
  - Bit it's a problem for "things" that runs on top of Ethereum



<!-- .slide: class="cclogo-slide" -->
## "Useful" Proof-of-Work (PoW)
- Use computing power for some "good"
- [![xpm logo](../slides/images/logos/xpm-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/primecoin/) Example: Primecoin, launched in 2013 <br clear='all'>
  - Purpose: generate primes for mathematical and scientific study
  - [Whitepaper](https://primecoin.io/bin/primecoin-paper.pdf)
  - Time between blocks: 1 minute
  - Difficulty change is for each block (not 2 weeks)
  - Generates two types of primes sequences: Cunningham chains and Bi-twin chains



## Cunningham chain
- Of the first kind: length $n$ sequence $(p_1, \ldots, p_n)$ such that: $p_{i+1} = 2p_i+1$
  - Each prime is one *more* than twice the previous
  - Example: 2, 5, 11, 23, 47
- Of the second kind: length $n$ sequence $(p_1, \ldots, p_n)$ such that: $p_{i+1} = 2p_i-1$
  - Each prime is one *less* than twice the previous
  - Example: 19, 37, 73
- Generalized:  length $n$ sequence $(p_1, \ldots, p_n)$ such that: $p_{i+1} = a \ast p_i + b$



## Bi-twin chain
- A sequence of primes of the form:
  - $n-1,n+1,2n-1,2n+1,\ldots,2^kn-1,2^kn+1$
  - Must have an even number of terms
- All examples are really large numbers...



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## ASIC mining

<img src="https://canaan.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/481e0bea4c81e2d568cf6ae91505937c.png" style="padding-left:0;padding-right:0">

- Some cryptocurrencies use hash algorithms that special-purpose hardware can mine
  - ASIC = application-specific integrated circuit
  - Bitcoin, Ethereum (before the ETH2 upgrade)



<!-- .slide: class="cclogo-slide" -->
## ASIC-resistant mining
- [![rvn logo](../slides/images/logos/rvn-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ravencoin/) Consider Ravencoin, which aims for ASIC-resistant mining <br clear='all'>
- It uses 16 different hash algorithms
  - The last 8 bytes of the previous block's hash determine which 8 algorithms to use
  - That's a *LOT* of hashes, and it is very power-intensive
- Many are skeptical of it's ASIC-resistance
  - If it were valuable enough, I'm sure somebody would develop an ASIC for it
- The developers regularly update the algorithm to try to maintain ASIC-resistance
  - Original algorithm was [x16r](https://ravencoin.org/assets/documents/X16R-Whitepaper.pdf), then x16rv2, and now kawpow



## Lite Hash Rate (LHR)
- Nvidia makes graphics card GPUs
  - And everybody was buying their cards to mine cryptocurrency
    - Which priced out their primary market: gamers
- Nvidia's solution: create LHR cards
  - Make the card recognize mining of Ethash, and "lock" the GPU for 20 seconds
  - But this only affects Ethash, not any other mining algorithm!
- Mining programs figured out how to *dual-mine*
  - It mines Ethash at half GPU usage and another coin for the other half
- Nvidia gave up on this in May 2022 and removed LHR in recent drivers



## Terminology
- The act of *certifying* a block is called different terms with different certification mechanisms
- Technically *mining* is certification on a proof-of-work blockchain
  - But, more generally, it encompasses any type of block certification
- Other terms: signing, validating, etc.



## Proof of Authority (PoA)
- A small set (possibly singleton) of accounts are *signers*
  - They form a *clique*
  - One signer signs a block
  - Then a majority (>50%) of the clique must agree
- Not great for a decentralized cryptocurrency!
- Our course blockchain uses this
  - The clique was defined in the genesis.json file
  - It makes mining (aka signing) much easier in a development setting
- Biggest uses: test networks, development environments, course blockchains



## Proof of Stake (PoS)
- Those with a *stake* in the cryptocurrency...
  - ... meaning they hold enough of it...
- Can be the ones to present a certified block to the network
  - They put their cryptocurrency "on the line" to vouch for the validity of the block
  - And they get the miner reward
- But what if the block is invalid?
  - Then the certifier loses some of their cryptocurrency
    - Called "slashing"
  - While not unknown, it rarely happens
- Those who can certify blocks are called *validators*



## Proof of Stake (PoS)
- The network chooses the validators based on:
  - Amount of currency held
  - Length of currency held
- Implementations vary by cryptocurrency
  - There is a way that those with less "stake" will be able to be the validators less often
- Coins that use this: Tezos, Cosmos, Peercoin, Tendermint, the ETH2 upgrade
  - ETH2 requires a minimum of 32 ETH to participate in PoS



<!-- .slide: class="cclogo-slide" -->
## [![eth logo](../slides/images/logos/eth-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) Ethereum and PoS
- Originally Ethereum was proof-of-work (hash algorithm: Ethash)
- It had a [difficulty bomb](https://docs.ethhub.io/questions-about-ethereum/what-is-the-difficulty-bomb/), aka "Ice Age"
  - At certain block numbers, the difficulty increases significantly
  - See [this graph](https://i.imgur.com/ac1xV3l.png) from the above link
- Purpose: to force the developers to either:
  - Migrate it to a later date (as has happened so far)
  - Change to PoS (in the works for some time now)
- The new Ethereum PoS proposal is called ETH2
  - Or the Paris Network Upgrade or the Casper protocol
  - It went live on September 15, 2022



<!-- .slide: class="cclogo-slide" -->
## [![eth logo](../slides/images/logos/eth-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) Ethereum's move to PoS
- Phase 0: December 2020: create the "Beacon Chain", a PoS blockchain
- Phase 1: September 15, 2022: change Ethereum from PoW to PoS
  - Last PoW block: [15,537,393](https://etherscan.io/block/15537393)
  - First PoS block: [15,537,394](https://etherscan.io/block/15537394)
- Phase 2: sometime in 2023: allow shards
  - We'll see [sharding in the scalability slide set](scalability.html#/sharding) 



<!-- .slide: class="cclogo-slide" -->
## [![ppc logo](../slides/images/logos/ppc-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/peercoin/) Peercoin
- First implementation of PoS, from 2012
  - [Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.io/document/139/peercoin-whitepaper), [source code on github](https://github.com/peercoin/peercoin)
- Consider *coin age*, measured in *coin-days*
  - 90 coins held for 10 days is 900 coin-days
  - Mining a block consumes the coin-days
    - Thus, those with a lower number of coins will eventually be able to mine a block



<!-- .slide: class="cclogo-slide" -->
## [![ppc logo](../slides/images/logos/ppc-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/peercoin/) Peercoin
- Weakness: buy a lot of Peercoin, and wait a long time
  - You can then mine many successive blocks, using a portion of your coin age each time
  - Then execute a [51% attack](bitcoin.html#/attacks)
- Solution: *checkpoints*
  - Basically a periodic (few times per day) proof-of-work mined block
  - The nodes all agree on the "offical" blockchain, which then is immutable



## Nothing-at-stake-problem
- Consider a fork in the blockchain due to two simultaneously mined blocks
  - This will happen occasionally!
- Which one chain should a validator mine for?
- Ideal strategy: mine both
  - In PoS, it is not computationally demanding to mine both
  - This way you don't mine the eventual "wrong" chain, and then not get the reward
- With PoS, there is nothing at stake to prevent mining both chains
- This can make double-spend attacks more feasible, as duplicate chains are not removed quickly



## Nothing-at-stake problem
- All coins must address this somehow
- ETH2:
  - Part of your stake is a "deposit" on the validity of the block
  - If that block does not make it into the full block chain, you lose that deposit



## Staking
- Let's say you wanted to be a validator for a PoS coin
- If you had more of that coin...
   - ... you could be "chosen" as the validator more often
   - ... and thus get more of the validator reward
- So you might "rent" coins from others to increase your balance



## Staking
- If you have some of a coin, you could "loan" it to others so they can better participate in PoS
  - This is called "staking"
- Advantages:
  - You get a payout: maybe 5% of your "loan" per year
- Disadvantages:
  - You can't get your "stake" back early
- A good choice if you definitely are not going to sell in the near future



## Staking Legality
- On Feb 3, 2022, the IRS said it will not tax unsold, staked crypto ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kamranrosen/2022/02/02/in-huge-precedent-irs-says-it-will-not-tax-unsold-staked-crypto/?sh=135dbc5f464c))
  - You still pay when you sell it, of course
- Such coins are "new property" not "income"
- Once sold, presumably you would pay taxes on it similar to how you pay taxes on interest
  - But that was not mentioned in that article...



<!-- .slide: class="cclogo-slide" -->
## Proof-of-History
- In ![sol logo](../slides/images/logos/sol-coin-symbol.svg#cclogo) Solana ([SOL](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/)) the block verification combines PoS and proof of history ([Solana's whitepaper](https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf))
  - Each transaction has a hash of *another* transaction
    - This proves that the TXN happened after the "other" transaction
    - This forms a chain (graph, really) of events in time
    - The blocks (maybe TXNs?) also have an actual timestamp
- This graph is:
  - Directed (any TXN points to a previous TXN)
  - Acyclic (you can't have a loop in time)
- Thus, the validator can always find the topological sort of a set of TXNs
  - Which means we can sequence them in the signed block



<!-- .slide: class="cclogo-slide" -->
## PoH and block verification
- With ![btc logo](../slides/images/logos/btc-coin-symbol.svg#cclogo) Bitcoin, we have to compute the Merkle tree hash
  - Given $n$ transactions, it takes $\Theta(n)$ steps to build the tree
  - Given infinite computing power, it takes $\Theta(\log n)$ steps
- In ![sol logo](../slides/images/logos/sol-coin-symbol.svg#cclogo) Solana, each transaction can be verified in parallel
  - Just check that it goes one link back to another valid TXN
  - Given $n$ transactions and an infinite computing power, it can be done in $\Theta(1)$ time
- A GPU can have 4,000 cores, and each can verify one TXN in parallel
  - Okay, not infinite, but still quite fast



<!-- .slide: class="cclogo-slide" -->
## Proof-of-Capacity
- aka Proof-of-replication (PoRep), proof-of-storage, etc.
- You allocate a certain amount of "capacity" to store the blockchain
  - Depending on amount, you are likely not holding all of the blockchain
- But all parts of the blockchain are on many machines
  - Benefit: in the case of a failure, the "storage" -- in the blockchain -- is replicated
- You pay to store data in the blockchain
- [![storj logo](../slides/images/logos/storj-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/storj/) Example: Storj



<!-- .slide: class="cclogo-slide" -->
## Proof-of-spacetime
- Spacetime means allocating space over a period of time
  - And is not related to Einstein's spacetime from relativity
- Like proof-of-capacity, but...
  - Your reward is based on the amount of space dedicated times the amount of time
- [![fil logo](../slides/images/logos/fil-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/filecoin/) Example: Filecoin



<!-- .slide: class="cclogo-slide" -->
## [![neox logo](../slides/images/logos/neox-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neoxa/) Neoxa: Proof-of-Game
- [Neoxa's whitepaper](https://www.neoxa.net/whitepaper)
- Intent is to reward video game players for actions taken in the game itself
  - See the table on [whitepaper page 3](https://www.neoxa.net/whitepaper)
- Pro: trying to get in early on the intersection of games and cryptocurrency
- Cons: so many to list here, where to start?



<!-- .slide: class="cclogo-slide" -->
## "Green" coins
- Generally, any coin that is not proof-of-work
- Possibilities:
  - Proof-of-stake, like ETH2 and Peercoin
  - Proof-of-{capacity, replication, spacetime}, like Storj and Filecoin
  - Does not require proofs, such as [![xlm logo](../slides/images/logos/xlm-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/)
 Stellar Lumens (XLM)
- There were also some pro-environment coins
  - That gave rewards for, say, producing renewable energy
  - No business model, so most have floundered

# DAGs

## Consider...
- The first few blocks of an arbitrary cryptocurrency...
- Here is the genesis block:

<img src="images/mining/dag/dag.dot.1.svg">



## The first block mined
<img src="images/mining/dag/dag.dot.2.svg">
Block 0 is on the top, block 1 is on the bottom



## Two blocks mined

We've just mined block 2



## A transaction

## Realism
- Most (all?) cryptocurrencies are mined by the developers for the first many blocks
  - Ethereum's first non-mining transaction was in block [46,147](https://etherscan.io/block/46147)
  - Bitcoin only had a few hundred accounts in the first 50,000 (or so) blocks
- But the previous images of the DAG still show the concepts of having many transactions



## DAGs
- The entire transaction list is a directed acyclic graph
  - aka DAG
- In order to successfully mine, this has to be kept in memory
  - as that tells you if a UTXO has already been spent or not
- Optimization: use hash tables (or similar)
  - Map a UTXO to the amount it makes available
  - And only keep track of the unspent UTXOs
- So not *really* a DAG, then...



## DAG size
- You can see DAG sizes at https://minerstat.com/dag-size-calculator
- Ethereum's is over 5 Gb (as of Sep 2022) <!-- change each semester -->
  - This means that graphics cards with less than 4 Gb cannot mine (sign, certify, whatever) ETH
- Consider Ravencoin, whose DAG is currently at 3.5 Gb (as of Sep 2022)
  - Based on the expected DAG growth...
    - 4 Gb GPUS will no longer be able to mine it around July 2023
    - 6 Gb GPUS will no longer be able to mine it around Mar 2027

    </textarea></section>



    <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea>
## Uncle / Orphan / Ommer blocks
- Bitcoin calls these *orphan nodes*
- Ethereum used to call them *uncle nodes*
  - But that is gender-specific
  - Now they are called *ommer blocks*
    - Ommer is a gender-neutral version of aunt or uncle
      - But not a native English word
    - Like "sibling" instead of brother or sister
- What happens to that TXN?
  - Other miners will likely pick it up
  - Wallet software (or equivalent) will re-send it if it "disappears"
    - Or at least notify you that it was not mined
- This is an issue if we all could mine the blockchain in this class
  - There is no effective way to ensure it is not discarded



## How to handle?
- Bitcoin's orphan blocks: once it is no longer part of the longest chain, is completely discarded
  - Reason: with 10 minute block time, this is much less likely to occur
- Ethereum's ommer blocks: not fully discarded
  - Miners still get a reward, albeit much smaller
  - The EVM keeps them around in memory
  - They are not the canonical "truth" of the blockchain, though
  - Reason: with a 15 second block time, this is much more likely to occur
  - They cannot happen on our proof-of-authority blockchain



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## Type 2: Soft forks

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*FBNBdZKQOI2FfJMRBto5pQ.jpeg" style="padding:0;background:transparent">

- Non-token crypto-currencies usually have a group of developers
  - Occasional changes are made to the protocol / mining algorithm / etc.
  - Bitcoin via [BIPs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/), Ethereum via [EIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/), etc.
- Sometimes called a *consensus fork*
- Generally, all the uses of the cryptocurrency (eventually) adopt the change
- These forks are backward-compatible
  - At least until everybody switches over



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
## Soft forks

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*FBNBdZKQOI2FfJMRBto5pQ.jpeg" style="padding:0;background:transparent">

- How to get all the miners to adopt it?
  - Release the updated source code
  - The agreed-upon change will state that at some point, all further blocks *must* have that change
  - That point could be when:
    - Some number (say, 75%) of the miners have adopted this change
    - After some date/time
    - ETH 2: when the Total Terminal Difficulty reaches (or exceeds) exactly $5.875*10^{22}$
- Example: Bitcoin's [Segregated Witness](bitcoin.html#/segwit) from 2015
  - Defined in [BIP 141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki)



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-nb-400" -->
## Type 3: Hard forks
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gabel_--_2021_--_7220.jpg/800px-Gabel_--_2021_--_7220.jpg)
- A change is proposed that some users do *NOT* want to adopt
  - Or that is not backwards-compatible, so some users choose one way and some the other way

## [![eth logo](../slides/images/logos/eth-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) Ethereum & <br> [![etc logo](../slides/images/logos/etc-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-classic/) Ethereum Classic
- A well-known Ethereum organization had a programming bug that allowed millions to be drained from the account
  - This endangered the perception and trust of the Ethereum as a whole
  - We'll see this error in detail in [Blockchain Applications](applications.html#/)
- The fix: roll back the blockchain to before the hack to fix it
- This [split the users](applications.html#/etcsplit); some didn't want the fix
- [![etc logo](../slides/images/logos/etc-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-classic/) Ethereum Classic is the blockchain *without* the fix

## [![btg logo](../slides/images/logos/btg-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-gold/) Bitcoin Gold

- Hard fork of Bitcoin on October 24, 2017 (at block height 491,407)
- Reasons: change to an ASIC-resistant hash
- It's had a lot of growing pains:
  - Was hastily put together
  - Had a developer pre-mine, which always looks shady
  - Hit by 51% attack in May 2018; 388k BTG (about $18 million) was stolen; promptly de-listed from Bittrex
  - Hit by a 51% attack again in January 2020
  - In July 2020 an "emergency update" was released to counter yet another attack




<!-- .slide: class="cclogo-slide" -->
## Type 4: Source code fork
- You can make a new cryptocurrency by:
  - Take a tested open source code base
  - Make a the modifications you want
- The [![rvn logo](../slides/images/logos/rvn-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ravencoin/) [Ravencoin (RVN) source code](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin) is based off of the [Bitcoin source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin); created in 2018
- Changes:
  - 1000x as many coins
  - 1 minute block time instead of 10 minutes
  - Native support for assets
    - Could be NFTs, but can represent any digital or physical item
  - Different PoW hashes to be ASIC resistant

## [![nmc logo](../slides/images/logos/nmc-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/namecoin/) Namecoin (2011)
- Namecoin (NMC) was created in 2011, also as a fork of Bitcoin
- Purpose: censorship-free domain DNS registration for the .bit top-level domain
  - Anybody can transact with Namecoin to reserve a domain in .bit
  - Fee: 0.01 NMC
  - Reservation lasts 36,000 blocks (about 200 days) unless updated or renewed
- .bit domains are not widely supported
  - Not sanction by [ICANN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN), not supported by [OpenNIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenNIC)
- Namecoin not very popular these days
  - In 2015: 120k domains registered, but only 28 in use

## Double spending
- Definition: when one submits two TXNs spending the same UTXO
- Prevented by:
  - The "valid block check" that miners & nodes perform checks for
    - Non-malicious nodes will not vote to approve a node that double spends
      - Or that spends an already-spent UTXO
  - In Bitcoin: having a witness hash for a transaction that cannot be changed



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
<img src='images/bitcoin/attack/attack.dot.1.svg' style='width:130px'>

## 51% attack
- This is an attack primarily on PoW blockchains
  - But still possible on PoS blockchains as well
- Given the initial state in some block, say 1000



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
<img src='images/bitcoin/attack/attack.dot.2.svg' style='width:130px'>

## 51% attack
- Mallory spends a UTXO
  - On something that has a quick delivery, such as a digital asset
  - Or a in-person transaction where she takes possession of a physical item



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
<img src='images/bitcoin/attack/attack.dot.3.svg' style='width:130px'>

## 51% attack
- Seller waits some number of confirmations...
  - Say, 3 (in reality, likely many more)
- Then the seller assumes the TXN will not change
  - Because there have been the desired number of confirmations
- The digital asset is then sent
  - Or the physical item changes hands



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
<img src='images/bitcoin/attack/attack.dot.4.svg' style='height:773px'>

## 51% attack
- The original spender tries to spend the UTXO again
  - Mine it into a block
- Node adoption policy: longest chain
  - The longest "chain" of blocks, starting from the genesis block, is the valid chain
- But how to make the rest of the network accept the second spending of the UTXO?
  - Make that second TXN part of the new longest chain



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img" -->
<img src='images/bitcoin/attack/attack.dot.5.svg' style='height:773px'>

## 51% attack
- But how to make the rest of the network accept it?
  - Make that second TXN part of the new longest chain
- Solution
  - Have to mine more than the rest of the network
  - Thus, must have 51% (or more) of the network mining capability, hence the name
- If the attacker...
  - Who has 51% (or more) of the mining power...
- ... can ever create the longest chain...
- Then they have "double spent" the UTXO!
  - Not *true* double spending, but close...



## Longest Chain Adoption Policy
- Miners are incentivized to always accept the longest chain as the "valid" chain
  - That chain has the greatest chance of becoming the "accepted" chain
    - After a certain number of confirmations
  - Any blocks mined on a different (and shorter) chain yield no reward, since their mined coins are not part of the longest chain
    - No reward means no incentive



<!-- .slide: class="cclogo-slide" -->
## 51% attack
- But is this viable?
  - As no one person is going to have 51% of the [BTC mining / hash capacity](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate?timespan=all)
- But a mining pool might for other cryptocurrencies
- Consider the [![rvn logo](../slides/images/logos/rvn-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ravencoin/) Ravencoin [pool from 2miners](https://2miners.com/rvn-mining-pool)
  - See what percentage they have now by dividing the pool hash rate by the network hash rate
  - On June 27th, they had over 51% ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ravencoin/comments/o96qox/2miners_is_showing_over_51_on_miningpoolstats/))
    - Due to a purchase of hashpower from (likely) Nicehash
- [![firo logo](../slides/images/logos/firo-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/firo/) Firo had one in January 2021
- [![btg logo](../slides/images/logos/btg-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-gold/) Bitcoin Gold had one in May 2018 and January 2020

## Required confirmations

<img src='images/bitcoin/attack/attack.dot.6.svg' style='773px'>

- Envision: we have two longest chains, and miners are split between the two
  - Neither has yet become "longer"
- What if the miner for block 1001, version 1, were to immediately spend those mined coins
  - And then the version 2 chain were to become the longer (and thus accepted) chain?
- Solution: wait until $n$ confirmations have occurred before allowing spending of the BTC



<!-- .slide: class="cclogo-slide" -->
## Confirmations
- Number of confirmations typically required (via [2miners](https://2miners.com)):
  - [![xlm logo](../slides/images/logos/xlm-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/) XLM: 0 blocks (5 seconds) (TXNs are irreversible)
  - [![btc logo](../slides/images/logos/btc-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) BTC: 6 blocks (about 1 hour) for "standard" transactions
  - [![eth logo](../slides/images/logos/eth-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) ETH: 240 blocks (about 1 hour) (maybe different w/PoS)
  - [![rvn logo](../slides/images/logos/rvn-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ravencoin/) RVN: 100 blocks (about 2 hours)
  - [![firo logo](../slides/images/logos/firo-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/firo/) FIRO: 100 blocks (about 9 hours)
  - [![btc logo](../slides/images/logos/btc-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) BTC: 60 blocks (about 10 hours) for "large" transactions
  - [![erg logo](../slides/images/logos/erg-coin-symbol.svg)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ergo/) ERG: 720 blocks (about 1 day)
- This is based on many factors: block speed, overall network hash rate, and the value of the coin
