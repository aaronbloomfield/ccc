## Recap
- Some current events:
  - Some lawmakers have introduced the [Crypto Tax Fairness Act](https://tittlepress.com/crypto/1522765/)
    - Encourages using them as a currency; standardizes how gains are taxed
    - This is different than what was mentioned on Monday
- We were part way through [Bitcoin](../slides/bitcoin.html#/)
  - We discussed Merkle trees
  - Recall a UTXO: unspent transaction output
  - Recall a [compactSize unsigned integer](../slides/bitcoin.html#/3/2): 1-9 bytes
  - Bitcoin's blockchain only has 5 types:
    - 4 byte (mostly) unsigned ints
    - 8 byte unsigned long ints
    - compactSize unsigned integer
    - 32 byte hash
    - Variable-length script
  - Just about everything in Bitcoin's blockchain is in little-Endian form
  - We ended on [Bitcoin slide 5.10](../slides/bitcoin.html#/4/9)

## Recap
- Thoughts on the [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/) ([PDF](https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/bitcoin.pdf))?
- Clarification: the hash used in Ethereum is SHA-3 (ake Keccak-256)
- Some current events:
  - Forbes is reporting that the [IRS Says It Will Not Tax Unsold, Staked Crypto](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kamranrosen/2022/02/02/in-huge-precedent-irs-says-it-will-not-tax-unsold-staked-crypto/?sh=135dbc5f464c)
    - We haven't seen staking yet, but think of it like your cryptocurrency gaining "interest"
  - There is a [Bipartisan Bill to Eliminate Taxes for Small Bitcoin Transactions](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bipartisan-bill-to-eliminate-taxes-for-small-bitcoin-transactions)
    - If the capital gains are $200 or less
    - [Here](https://www.thebharatexpressnews.com/us-lawmakers-reintroduce-bill-to-prevent-irs-from-taxing-crypto-transactions-under-200/) is another article on this
- We *almost* finished [encryption](../slides/encryption.html#/)
  - We saw random number generation and most of hashing
  - We ended on [encryption slide 9.21](../slides/encryption.html#/8/20)
  - I added a [slide on security level](../slides/encryption.html#/6/25)

## Recap
- We nailed ECDSA to the wall
  - Recall that a 256-bit ECDSA signature is considered about as hard to crack as a 3072-bit RSA signature

## Corrections & Clarifications
- BTC reward includes transaction fees
  - See the latest block [here](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer)
- Inflation versus deflation re: BTC growth
- Mining
  - The reward address prevents using a mining pool but submitting it yourself
- "Ledger", meaning non-mined transactions, is my term for clarity, and not an official term
  - It's actually called 'mempool' -- the pool of transactions still in memory (as opposed to in a block)
  - You can see it's size [here](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer)

## Recap: Bitcoin terms
- Wallet: a set of public/private key pairs
- Bitcoin address: the public key of one of those key pairs
- Node: a machine that takes part in the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network
  - The BTC node software looks like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Bitcoin-core-v0.10.0.png)
- Ledger: the transactions that have just occurred, and have not yet become "official"
- Block: a list of transactions that have occurred "officially", along with the hash of the previous block
- Blockchain: all the blocks
  - BTC is at about 720,000 blocks in the blockchain
  - Ethereum is at about 1.4 million blocks in the blockchain
- Miner: we'll get to that, but it's typically NOT a node
