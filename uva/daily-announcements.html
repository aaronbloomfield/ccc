## Lecture 21: Wed, April 6th
- [BTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD): `$`43,500; [ETH](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD): `$`3,195; [ETH gas](https://ethgas.watch/): 78 gwei => `$`5.23
- Homeworks
  - [HW P7: dApp auction](../hws/auction/index.html) was due yesterday by midnight
    - We'll talk about that next...
  - HW P8: DEX will be out tonight
  - How to work through unit testing?  As part of P8 or a separate HW?
  - Upcoming: zero-knowledge proofs, then two on Web3
- I'm told the requests for your UVA CS server accounts have been handled
  - If you didn't receive it via email, try to resetting your password at [www.cs.virginia.edu/computing](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/computing)
- Grades: 
  - HW P6 (Tokens) grades are on Collab's Posted Feedback
    - Regrades can take TWO forms for this:
    - A quick fix (NFT ownership issue, unknown NFT token ID, etc.) is just a resubmit with an explanation in the comments box
    - Otherwise via support request
  - Regrade policy: submit a regrade within 1 week of when it's returned
    - Or speak to me, or submit a support request; exams / quizzes: submit via Gradescope, not a support request
- Office hours
  - Mine: M/W 9-10 & F 1-2 in Rice 402
  - John: Mondays from 11am - 1pm in Olsson 001
  - Matt: Tu/Th from 2pm - 3pm in Olsson 001
- Today we will finish with work through [Blockchain applications](../slides/applications.html#/)
  - And then come back to the rest of [Ethereum](../slides/ethereum.html#/) (we ended on, but did not go over, [slide 3.27](../slides/ethereum.html#/2/26))



## HW P7: Auctions
- I realize that assignment was unintentionally much rougher than intended, and I'm sorry about that
- The problems generally fell into a few categories:
  1. That homework document clearly needed a few more editing runs
  2. How to pass in, store, and report money (wei versus gwei)
  3. The process of calling `createAuction()` then transferring the NFT over
  4. Difficulty testing and needing to "harden" it against attacks
  5. Not having gone over some Solidity concepts
- The Auctioneer is going to be used in a future assignment
  - For (2), the updated version will have all monetary units in wei



<!-- .slide: class="normal-slide-size" -->
## News and Recap
- Last time we finished about [Consensus](../slides/consensus.html#/)
- We started on [Blockchain applications](../slides/applications.html#/)
  - We discussed the Constant Product Automated Market Maker method for DEXs
    - Where $x \ast y = k$
  - We ended on [slide 3.28](../slides/applications.html#/2/27)
- At some point we still have to come back to the rest of [Ethereum](../slides/ethereum.html#/) (we ended on, but did not go over, [slide 3.27](../slides/ethereum.html#/2/26))

## geth usage++
Save this to `preload.js`:

<pre class="code-wrapper"><code class="hljs awk small" style="height:auto;width:120%"
>function mineOneBlock() {
    var start = eth.blockNumber;
    miner.start();
    while ( start == eth.blockNumber );
    miner.stop();
    return eth.blockNumber;
}

function checkAllBalances() { 
    // this function from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32312884/
    //               how-do-i-get-the-balance-of-an-account-in-ethereum
    var i = 0;
    var total = 0;
    for ( var i = 0; i < eth.accounts.length; i++ ) {
        var e = eth.accounts[i];
        console.log("  eth.accounts["+i+"]: " +  e + " \tbalance: " + 
                    web3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(e), "ether") + " ether");
        total += parseFloat(web3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(e), "ether"));
    }
    console.log("Total: " + total + " ETH");
}
</code></pre>



<!-- .slide: class="normal-slide-size" -->
## geth usage++
Then run geth as:

```
geth --preload preload.js attach /path/to/geth.ipc
```

In geth, you can run `mineOneBlock()` and `checkAllBalances()`

This is now on the [docs/](../docs/index.html) page in the repo, specifically the [geth reference](../docs/geth_reference.html)



<!-- .slide: class="normal-slide-size" -->
## News and Recap
- Last time we continued talking about [Consensus](../slides/consensus.html#/)
  - We saw two solutions to the Byzantine Generals Problem:
  - $OM(m)$, the oral messages algorithm, that can tolerate $< 1/3$ traitors
  - $SM(m)$, the signed messages algorithm, that can support many more traitors
  - We ended on [slide 8.14](../slides/consensus.html#/7/13)
- At some point we still have to come back to the rest of [Ethereum](../slides/ethereum.html#/) (we ended on, but did not go over, [slide 3.27](../slides/ethereum.html#/2/26))

<!-- .slide: class="normal-slide-size" -->
## News and Recap
- Last time we started talking about [Consensus](../slides/consensus.html#/)
  - I flubbed the explanation of the [last case of the Three Generals problem](../slides/consensus.html#/5/12) because I had incorrectly not listed [requirement 3 for such](../slides/consensus.html#/5/6)
- We discussed:
  - The [Two Generals Problem](../slides/consensus.html#/3/2) (how do they communicate?)
  - [The Byzantine Generals Problem](../slides/consensus.html#/4/2) (BGP)
  - The [Three Generals Problem](../slides/consensus.html#/5/3)
    - This is modelling communication in the overall BGP
    - We showed does not work with 3 generals, 1 of which is a traitor
    - Nor does it work with 1/3 or more traitors
  - We ended on [slide 6.19](../slides/consensus.html#/5/18), and will start today on [slide 7.1](../slides/consensus.html#/om)
- At some point we still have to come back to the rest of [Ethereum](../slides/ethereum.html#/) (we ended on, but did not go over, [slide 3.27](../slides/ethereum.html#/2/26))

## Grades

| Assignment | Avg | Time (h) |
|----------|----|----|
| HW S1 (survey) | 9.65 | |
| HW S2 (Bitcoin whitepaper) | 7.56 | |
| HW S3 (Ethereum whitepaper) | 7.28 | |
| HW S4 (private Ethereum) | 9.59
| HW P1 (intro) | 8.70 | |
| HW P2 (ECDSA) | 9.47 | |
| HW P3 (BTC Parser) | 8.49 | |
| HW P4 (BTC Scripting) | 9.22 | |
| HW S5 (dApp intro) | 9.89 | 2.14 h |
| HW P6 (dApp gradebook) | 8.93 | 3.35 h |



## Grades
- These grades are without:
  - Any regrades counted in
  - Considering those who got a zero on the assignment
- Homework average so far is 8.88 (88.78/100)
- Exam average is 43.0/60 (71.7%)
  - We'll take this as the overall exam grade
- Homeworks are weighted at 50% of the grade, exams at 35%
- The class average is thus: $\frac{88.8 \ast 0.50+71.7 \ast 0.35}{0.85} = 81.8$%



## How is our NFT doing?

## Lecture 16: Mon, March 21st
- [BTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD): `$`41,047; [ETH](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD): `$`2,917; [ETH gas](https://ethgas.watch/): 47 gwei => `$`2.88
- The [midterm](../exams/exam1-s22.pdf) is all graded; we'll go over it today
  - Average was 40.5/60 (67.5%) with a standard deviation of 7.3/60 (12.2%)
  - I have to handle the too long answer issue
  - Yes, there will be a curve, but I don't know how much yet until I resolve the previous bullet point
- Upcoming schedule
  - [HW P5: dApp gradebook](../hws/gradebook/index.html) is due tomorrow by midnight; the [Gradebook.sol](../hws/gradebook/Gradebook.sol.html) ([src](../hws/gradebook/Gradebook.sol)) file has been updated
  - Due next Tuesday will be a HW on Tokens
  - Upcoming HWs: smart contracts on NFT auctions and a DEX, one on zero-knowledge proofs, then two on Web3
- Grades: 
  - HW S5 (dApp Introduction) grades on on Collab's Posted Feedback
    - If you messed up the hashes, please re-submit the Google form then submit a support request asking for a regrade
  - I am working through all the regrades
  - Regrade policy: submit a regrade within 1 week of when it's returned
    - Or speak to me, or submit a support request
    - Exams / quizzes: submit via Gradescope, not a support request
- Office hours
  - Mine: M/W 9-10 & F 1-2 in Rice 402

  - Matt: Tu/Th from 2pm - 3pm in Olsson 001
- Today we will start on [Tokens](../slides/tokens.html#/)



## Geth issues
- Some are having problems with it connecting; try adding `--syncmode "full"` to the flags
  <pre class="code-wrapper"><code class="hljs awk small" style="height:auto;width:120%"
>geth --datadir /path/to/ethprivate --networkid 12345678 --maxpeers 1 \
                --syncmode "full"
</code></pre>
  - You may have to delete the /path/to/ethprivate/geth directory and restart it
    - First, copy /path/to/ethprivate/geth/static-nodes.json somewhere
  - For example:
<pre class="code-wrapper"><code class="hljs awk small" style="height:auto;width:120%"
>cd /path/to/ethprivate
cp geth/static-nodes.json .
/bin/rm -rf ./geth
geth --identity "mst3k" --datadir ./ init ./genesis.json
cp static-nodes.json geth/
geth --datadir /path/to/ethprivate --networkid 12345678 --maxpeers 1 \
                --syncmode "full"
</code></pre>

## News and Recap
- Game mining crypto is continuing...
  - See [Roblox Players Are Mining Crypto Just to Get Robux](https://www.vice.com/en/article/epxkmk/roblox-mine-robux-cryptocurrency)
- We went through a live coding exercise of Solidity
- We saw the geth transactions to the Debts smart contract change the web page in real time
  - But those changes weren't preserved!
  - Here's why...

<!-- .slide: class="normal-slide-size" -->
## Recap
- Ethereum round-up: we ended on [slide 3.27](../slides/ethereum.html#/2/26)
  - Ethereum is the network, ether (or ETH) is the currency
    - One wei is $10^{-18}$ ETH; one giga-wei (aka gwei) is $10^{-9}$ ETH
  - Account address is the first 20 bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of the ECDSA key
  - An Ethereum transaction can hold a program, called a smart contract, which is compiled into bytecode
    - That program has a *contract address* to find it
    - Formed by taking the hash of the account address and nonce++
  - Fees are called *gas*
    - You specify how much gas you are willing to spend (aka startgas)
    - And how much you are willing to pay for gas
    - Different instructions use different amounts of gas
  - Messages: calling a function (method) on a smart contract
- Today: programming in [Solidity](../slides/solidity.html#/)

## Recap
- Bitcoin Whale Watch
  - Consider [this Bitcoin transaction from Saturday, Feb 12, 2022](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/30c1ed1dd14e2a0efa26f94363ceef55b17fca6b74020ac260901976e580636b)
  - That was for 30,100 BTC, worth `$`1.3 *billion*
- Apparently there were a lot of cryptocurrency Super Bowl commercials...
- We are working through [Bitcoin](../slides/bitcoin.html#/)
  - Recall a UTXO: unspent transaction output
  - Each transaction has one or more inputs and one or more outputs
  - Each input has a script, called a *sigscript*
  - Each output also has a script, called a *pubKey script*
  - We ended on [Bitcoin slide 7.6](../slides/bitcoin.html#/6/5)

## Recap
- Some current events:
  - Some lawmakers have introduced the [Crypto Tax Fairness Act](https://tittlepress.com/crypto/1522765/)
    - Encourages using them as a currency; standardizes how gains are taxed
    - This is different than what was mentioned on Monday
- We were part way through [Bitcoin](../slides/bitcoin.html#/)
  - We discussed Merkle trees
  - Recall a UTXO: unspent transaction output
  - Recall a [compactSize unsigned integer](../slides/bitcoin.html#/3/2): 1-9 bytes
  - Bitcoin's blockchain only has 5 types:
    - 4 byte (mostly) unsigned ints
    - 8 byte unsigned long ints
    - compactSize unsigned integer
    - 32 byte hash
    - Variable-length script
  - Just about everything in Bitcoin's blockchain is in little-Endian form
  - We ended on [Bitcoin slide 5.10](../slides/bitcoin.html#/4/9)

## Recap
- Thoughts on the [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/) ([PDF](https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/bitcoin.pdf))?
- Clarification: the hash used in Ethereum is SHA-3 (ake Keccak-256)
- Some current events:
  - Forbes is reporting that the [IRS Says It Will Not Tax Unsold, Staked Crypto](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kamranrosen/2022/02/02/in-huge-precedent-irs-says-it-will-not-tax-unsold-staked-crypto/?sh=135dbc5f464c)
    - We haven't seen staking yet, but think of it like your cryptocurrency gaining "interest"
  - There is a [Bipartisan Bill to Eliminate Taxes for Small Bitcoin Transactions](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bipartisan-bill-to-eliminate-taxes-for-small-bitcoin-transactions)
    - If the capital gains are $200 or less
    - [Here](https://www.thebharatexpressnews.com/us-lawmakers-reintroduce-bill-to-prevent-irs-from-taxing-crypto-transactions-under-200/) is another article on this
- We *almost* finished [encryption](../slides/encryption.html#/)
  - We saw random number generation and most of hashing
  - We ended on [encryption slide 9.21](../slides/encryption.html#/8/20)
  - I added a [slide on security level](../slides/encryption.html#/6/25)

## Corrections & Clarifications
- BTC reward includes transaction fees
  - See the latest block [here](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer)
- Inflation versus deflation re: BTC growth
- Mining
  - The reward address prevents using a mining pool but submitting it yourself
- "Ledger", meaning non-mined transactions, is my term for clarity, and not an official term
  - It's actually called 'mempool' -- the pool of transactions still in memory (as opposed to in a block)
  - You can see it's size [here](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer)

## Recap: Bitcoin terms
- Wallet: a set of public/private key pairs
- Bitcoin address: the public key of one of those key pairs
- Node: a machine that takes part in the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network
  - The BTC node software looks like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Bitcoin-core-v0.10.0.png)
- Ledger: the transactions that have just occurred, and have not yet become "official"
- Block: a list of transactions that have occurred "officially", along with the hash of the previous block
- Blockchain: all the blocks
  - BTC is at about 720,000 blocks in the blockchain
  - Ethereum is at about 1.4 million blocks in the blockchain
- Miner: we'll get to that, but it's typically NOT a node
