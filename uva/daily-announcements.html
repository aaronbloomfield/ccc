  - There will be a *practical* component, so you will all need to show up with a laptop / notebook with geth installed and configured

  - Last semester's [final](../exams/final-s22.pdf) is in the repo
- Office hours (all listed on the [Collab landing page](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/e9ad2fbb-faca-414b-9df1-6f9019e765e9)) end tomorrow

## The End

  - It will be reset, with a different chain ID, in early January
  - You can access it until then, and I'll keep the auto-miner running until it's reset
- Today we will finish [the dark side of cryptocurrency](../slides/darkside.html#/) (starting [here](../slides/darkside.html#/5/17)) and finish the [course conclusion](../slides/conclusion.html#/)

    - You can skip (or quickly browse) the first 3 sub-parts of the 'History' section ('Bitcoin', 'Mining', and 'Merkle Trees'); also skip the 'references and further reading' section at the end; what's left is 24 pages in the PDF to read

## News & Recap
- [Ethereum's Merge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Ethereum_2.0) happened last Thursday (9/16) morning around 1 a.m.
  - Ethereum moved to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain from a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain
  - This had lots of implications:
    - A lot of GPUs were mining Ethereum, as it was one of the most profitable coins mineable on a GPU
      - These GPUs all moved to mining other PoW coins
    - These other PoW coins' prices dipped a bit (many miners tend to sell right away), but not a lot
    - The coins earned per GPU went down by maybe 75%
      - Consider a nVidia 3090 GPU: it [now earns about `$`0.50 per day](https://2cryptocalc.com/gpu/24h/3090/1), when it used to earn about `$`2 per day
        - As electricity to run it costs about `$`1, that's not much profit anymore
        - In the heyday, it used to make `$`4 to `$`5 per day
      - Decrease mostly due to the increased hash rate; see that for [RVN](https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/ravencoin/hashrate-chart), [BEAM](https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/beam/hashrate-chart), etc.
        - And see how [Ethereum's dropped](https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/ethereum/hashrate-chart)
    - GPU prices have tanked; consider the price graph of a [MSI RTX 3090 GPU](https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B08HR9D2JS)
- Recap: Last time we worked through the [Bitcoin script](../slides/bitcoin.html#/script) column of slides
  - Today finish Bitcoin (remaining [Bitcoin script](../slides/bitcoin.html#/script) slides and [cross-chain transactions](../slides/bitcoin.html#/xchain)), then start on [mining](../slides/mining.html#/)
  - We'll start [here](../slides/bitcoin.html#/6/26)

## News & Recap
- [Ethereum's Merge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Ethereum_2.0) is going to happen today or tomorrow
  - This is phase 2 of their three phase switch to proof-of-stake
    - Phase 1 was the creation of the PoS blockchain, the so-called Beacon Chain, happened on Dec 1, 2020
    - Phase 3, which is sharding (we'll see that in [scalability](scalability.html#/)) is planned for 2023
  - Countdown site [here](https://www.totaldifficulty.com/)
  - It will happen when the terminal total difficulty (TTD) reaches (or exceeds) exactly $5.875*10^{22}$
    - TTD is the sum of all the difficulties of all the blocks in the blockchain
    - Estimated to happen around block 15,536,500 or so
- I made an error in my presentation & slides last time
  - On [this slide](../slides/bitcoin.html#/4/17), the prefix'ed 0x00 byte on a Bitcoin address specifies the *type* of address it is; see the list [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/List_of_address_prefixes)
  - Using 0x00 for that example was still valid, though; just the reason was wrong
- I also added a slide on [Bitcoin difficulty computation](../slides/bitcoin.html#/4/20); we'll start here today
- We discussed more about [Bitcoin](../slides/bitcoin.html#/) last time

## News
- [Crypto’s massive marketing efforts have drawn few new investors](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/24/cryptos-massive-marketing-efforts-have-drawn-few-new-investors/), Washington Post, August 24, 2022
  - [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com) paid `$`700 million to name the (formerly named) Los Angeles's Staples Center as the [Crypto.com Arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto.com_Arena) for 20 years
  - That's where the LA Kings (hockey), Lakers (men's basketball), Clippers (men's basketball), and Sparks (women's basketball) all play
- [Avalanche (AVAX)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/), run by [Ava labs](https://www.avalabs.org/) has the 16th highest market capitalization
  - Recently allegations (and ONLY allegations at this point) have emerged that:
    - Ava Labs made a pact with the legal team Roche Feedman, and paid them AVAX now worth hundreds of millions of dollars, to:
      1. Use the American legal system to attack AVAX competitors
      2. Start lawsuits to distract from the commercial nature of Ava Labs
      3. Pursue the personal vendettas of [Emin Sirer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emin_G%C3%BCn_Sirer) (AVAX's founder)
  - Unclear if true, but there are video recordings
    - (Granted, they could be deepfakes)
