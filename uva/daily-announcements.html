## News & Recap
- [Ethereum's Merge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Ethereum_2.0) is going to happen today or tomorrow
  - This is phase 2 of their three phase switch to proof-of-stake
    - Phase 1 was the creation of the PoS blockchain, the so-called Beacon Chain, happened on Dec 1, 2020
    - Phase 3, which is sharding (we'll see that in [scalability](scalability.html#/)) is planned for 2023
  - Countdown site [here](https://www.totaldifficulty.com/)
  - It will happen when the terminal total difficulty (TTD) reaches (or exceeds) exactly $5.875*10^{22}$
    - TTD is the sum of all the difficulties of all the blocks in the blockchain
    - Estimated to happen around block 15,536,500 or so
- I made an error in my presentation & slides last time
  - On [this slide](../slides/bitcoin.html#/4/17), the prefix'ed 0x00 byte on a Bitcoin address specifies the *type* of address it is; see the list [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/List_of_address_prefixes)
  - Using 0x00 for that example was still valid, though; just the reason was wrong
- I also added a slide on [Bitcoin difficulty computation](../slides/bitcoin.html#/4/20); we'll start here today
- We discussed more about [Bitcoin](../slides/bitcoin.html#/) last time
  - Covering [Bitcoin concepts and terminology](../slides/bitcoin.html#/concepts) and [Blockchain description](../slides/bitcoin.html#/blockchain)
  Next up: [Bitcoin script](../slides/bitcoin.html#/script)

## News
- [Cryptoâ€™s massive marketing efforts have drawn few new investors](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/24/cryptos-massive-marketing-efforts-have-drawn-few-new-investors/), Washington Post, August 24, 2022
  - [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com) paid `$`700 million to name the (formerly named) Los Angeles's Staples Center as the [Crypto.com Arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto.com_Arena) for 20 years
  - That's where the LA Kings (hockey), Lakers (men's basketball), Clippers (men's basketball), and Sparks (women's basketball) all play
- [Avalanche (AVAX)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/), run by [Ava labs](https://www.avalabs.org/) has the 16th highest market capitalization
  - Recently allegations (and ONLY allegations at this point) have emerged that:
    - Ava Labs made a pact with the legal team Roche Feedman, and paid them AVAX now worth hundreds of millions of dollars, to:
      1. Use the American legal system to attack AVAX competitors
      2. Start lawsuits to distract from the commercial nature of Ava Labs
      3. Pursue the personal vendettas of [Emin Sirer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emin_G%C3%BCn_Sirer) (AVAX's founder)
  - Unclear if true, but there are video recordings
    - (Granted, they could be deepfakes)
