## News
- [Cryptoâ€™s massive marketing efforts have drawn few new investors](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/24/cryptos-massive-marketing-efforts-have-drawn-few-new-investors/), Washington Post, August 24, 2022
  - [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com) paid `$`700 million to name the (formerly named) Los Angeles's Staples Center as the [Crypto.com Arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto.com_Arena) for 20 years
  - That's where the LA Kings (hockey), Lakers (men's basketball), Clippers (men's basketball), and Sparks (women's basketball) all play
- [Avalanche (AVAX)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/), run by [Ava labs](https://www.avalabs.org/) has the 16th highest market capitalization
  - Recently allegations (and ONLY allegations at this point) have emerged that:
    - Ava Labs made a pact with the legal team Roche Feedman, and paid them AVAX now worth hundreds of millions of dollars, to:
      1. Use the American legal system to attack AVAX competitors
      2. Start lawsuits to distract from the commercial nature of Ava Labs
      3. Pursue the personal vendettas of [Emin Sirer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emin_G%C3%BCn_Sirer) (AVAX's founder)
  - Unclear if true, but there are video recordings
    - (Granted, they could be deepfakes)
  - See [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/x0a1q6/ava_labs_have_zero_shame_please_read_this_post_to/)
