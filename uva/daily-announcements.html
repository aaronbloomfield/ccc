## Regrades
- All programming assignments are auto-graded; written "things" (exams and quizzes) are not
- If your auto-graded assignment got a low score due to:
  - An auto-grader failure
  - A genuine mis-understanding of the assignment due to poor wording on our part
  - A set of auto-grader tests that you do not think were fair
- Then you can submit a regrade
- You cannot submit a regrade for:
  - Getting it wrong
  - Wanting more points
  - Your dog eating your homework
- To do so, submit a support request within *1 week* of when it's returned
  - If you do it 8 days later, I'm probably not going to care
  - But 2 weeks later?  No dice
  - In the support request, explain why you feel you should get more points
- This applies to all graded items in this course other than the final
  - Due to that being the end of the semester, it has a shorter time period, but I'll make sure everybody knows about it at that point
- Regrade support requests for exams/quizzes typically stalled and handled at the *very end of the semester*
