## Lecture 16: Wed, March 23rd
- [BTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD): `$`42,101; [ETH](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD): `$`2,954; [ETH gas](https://ethgas.watch/): 25 gwei => `$`1.55
- The [midterm](../exams/exam1-s22.pdf)'s grading problem is fixed; regrades to be open for 1 week
  - Average was 40.5/60 (67.5%) with a standard deviation of 7.3/60 (12.2%); about the curve...
- Homeworks
  - [HW P5: dApp gradebook](../hws/gradebook/index.html) was due yesterday by midnight; it seemed to go okay
  - [HW P6: dApp tokens](../hws/tokens/index.html) is due next Tuesday by midnight
  - Upcoming: smart contracts on NFT auctions and a DEX, 1 on zero-knowledge proofs, then 2 on Web3
- You are all about to get UVA CS server accounts
  - Info will arrive by email; we'll need it for future assignments
- Grades: 
  - HW S5 (dApp Introduction) grades on on Collab's Posted Feedback
    - If you messed up the hashes, please re-submit the Google form then submit a support request asking for a regrade
  - Wow, I really messed up those homework regrades...
  - Regrade policy: submit a regrade within 1 week of when it's returned
    - Or speak to me, or submit a support request
    - Exams / quizzes: submit via Gradescope, not a support request

  - Mine: M/W 9-10 & F 1-2 in Rice 402
  - John: Mondays from 11am - 1pm in Olsson 001
  - Matt: Tu/Th from 2pm - 3pm in Olsson 001
- Today we will continue with [Tokens](../slides/tokens.html#/)



## How is our NFT doing?
Let's check in!  The NFT is [here](https://opensea.io/assets/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/8337), and shown below:

<!-- .slide: class="normal-slide-size" -->
## News and Recap
- We started [Tokens](../slides/tokens.html#/) on Monday, ending on [slide 5.3](../slides/tokens.html#/4/2)
  - The standards are so the various wallet software have a uniform way to interact with these tokens
  - ERC-165 is the `supportsInterface()` function
  - ERC-20 is *fungible* tokens
- At some point we still have to come back to the rest of [Ethereum](../slides/ethereum.html#/) (we ended on, but did not go over, [slide 3.27](../slides/ethereum.html#/2/26))

## Lecture 15: Mon, March 21st
- [BTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD): `$`41,047; [ETH](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD): `$`2,917; [ETH gas](https://ethgas.watch/): 47 gwei => `$`2.88
- The [midterm](../exams/exam1-s22.pdf) is all graded; we'll go over it today
  - Average was 40.5/60 (67.5%) with a standard deviation of 7.3/60 (12.2%)
  - I have to handle the too long answer issue
  - Yes, there will be a curve, but I don't know how much yet until I resolve the previous bullet point
- Upcoming schedule
  - [HW P5: dApp gradebook](../hws/gradebook/index.html) is due tomorrow by midnight; the [Gradebook.sol](../hws/gradebook/Gradebook.sol.html) ([src](../hws/gradebook/Gradebook.sol)) file has been updated
  - Due next Tuesday will be a HW on Tokens
  - Upcoming HWs: smart contracts on NFT auctions and a DEX, one on zero-knowledge proofs, then two on Web3
- Grades: 
  - HW S5 (dApp Introduction) grades on on Collab's Posted Feedback
    - If you messed up the hashes, please re-submit the Google form then submit a support request asking for a regrade
  - I am working through all the regrades
  - Regrade policy: submit a regrade within 1 week of when it's returned
    - Or speak to me, or submit a support request
    - Exams / quizzes: submit via Gradescope, not a support request
- Office hours
  - Mine: M/W 9-10 & F 1-2 in Rice 402

  - Matt: Tu/Th from 2pm - 3pm in Olsson 001
- Today we will start on [Tokens](../slides/tokens.html#/)



## Geth issues
- Some are having problems with it connecting; try adding `--syncmode "full"` to the flags
  <pre class="code-wrapper"><code class="hljs awk small" style="height:auto;width:120%"
>geth --datadir /path/to/ethprivate --networkid 12345678 --maxpeers 1 \
                --syncmode "full"
</code></pre>
  - You may have to delete the /path/to/ethprivate/geth directory and restart it
    - First, copy /path/to/ethprivate/geth/static-nodes.json somewhere
  - For example:
<pre class="code-wrapper"><code class="hljs awk small" style="height:auto;width:120%"
>cd /path/to/ethprivate
cp geth/static-nodes.json .
/bin/rm -rf ./geth
geth --identity "mst3k" --datadir ./ init ./genesis.json
cp static-nodes.json geth/
geth --datadir /path/to/ethprivate --networkid 12345678 --maxpeers 1 \
                --syncmode "full"
</code></pre>

## News and Recap
- Game mining crypto is continuing...
  - See [Roblox Players Are Mining Crypto Just to Get Robux](https://www.vice.com/en/article/epxkmk/roblox-mine-robux-cryptocurrency)
- We went through a live coding exercise of Solidity
- We saw the geth transactions to the Debts smart contract change the web page in real time
  - But those changes weren't preserved!
  - Here's why...

<!-- .slide: class="normal-slide-size" -->
## Recap
- Ethereum round-up: we ended on [slide 3.27](../slides/ethereum.html#/2/26)
  - Ethereum is the network, ether (or ETH) is the currency
    - One wei is $10^{-18}$ ETH; one giga-wei (aka gwei) is $10^{-9}$ ETH
  - Account address is the first 20 bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of the ECDSA key
  - An Ethereum transaction can hold a program, called a smart contract, which is compiled into bytecode
    - That program has a *contract address* to find it
    - Formed by taking the hash of the account address and nonce++
  - Fees are called *gas*
    - You specify how much gas you are willing to spend (aka startgas)
    - And how much you are willing to pay for gas
    - Different instructions use different amounts of gas
  - Messages: calling a function (method) on a smart contract
- Today: programming in [Solidity](../slides/solidity.html#/)

- Larger programming homeworks
  - How was [HW P3: BTC parser](../hws/btcparser/index.html)?  Some comments about that...
  - Due Tuesday, Feb 22nd will be [HW P4: Bitcoin scripting](../hws/btcscript/index.html)
    - We saw two parts on Monday (P2PKH & multi-sig), and will see the other two today (puzzle & cross-chain)
  - HWs P5-P8 will be on Ethereum and smart contracts (currently: money, auction, cryptocurrency, DEX)
- Grades
  - HW S1 (Google survey) grades and any attendance quizzes are in Collab's Posted Feedback tool

<!-- .slide: class="normal-slide-size" -->
## Recap
- We were chatting about Bitcoin, specifically Bitcoin Script
  - Went over the P2PKH (pay to public key hash) example in detail
  - Saw OP_CHECKMULTISIG in detail
  - We discussed witnesses
  - We saw the "standard" transactions:
    - P2PKH (pay to public key hash)
    - P2PK (pay to public key; obsolete)
    - P2SH (pay to script hash)
    - P2WPKH (pay to witness public key hash)
    - P2WSH (pay to witness script hash)
- We ended on [Bitcoin slide 7.36](../slides/bitcoin.html#/6/35)
  - Although we skipped the slide immediately prior to that one

## Recap
- Bitcoin Whale Watch
  - Consider [this Bitcoin transaction from Saturday, Feb 12, 2022](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/30c1ed1dd14e2a0efa26f94363ceef55b17fca6b74020ac260901976e580636b)
  - That was for 30,100 BTC, worth `$`1.3 *billion*
- Apparently there were a lot of cryptocurrency Super Bowl commercials...
- We are working through [Bitcoin](../slides/bitcoin.html#/)
  - Recall a UTXO: unspent transaction output
  - Each transaction has one or more inputs and one or more outputs
  - Each input has a script, called a *sigscript*
  - Each output also has a script, called a *pubKey script*
  - We ended on [Bitcoin slide 7.6](../slides/bitcoin.html#/6/5)

## Recap
- Some current events:
  - Some lawmakers have introduced the [Crypto Tax Fairness Act](https://tittlepress.com/crypto/1522765/)
    - Encourages using them as a currency; standardizes how gains are taxed
    - This is different than what was mentioned on Monday
- We were part way through [Bitcoin](../slides/bitcoin.html#/)
  - We discussed Merkle trees
  - Recall a UTXO: unspent transaction output
  - Recall a [compactSize unsigned integer](../slides/bitcoin.html#/3/2): 1-9 bytes
  - Bitcoin's blockchain only has 5 types:
    - 4 byte (mostly) unsigned ints
    - 8 byte unsigned long ints
    - compactSize unsigned integer
    - 32 byte hash
    - Variable-length script
  - Just about everything in Bitcoin's blockchain is in little-Endian form
  - We ended on [Bitcoin slide 5.10](../slides/bitcoin.html#/4/9)

## Recap
- Thoughts on the [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/) ([PDF](https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/bitcoin.pdf))?
- Clarification: the hash used in Ethereum is SHA-3 (ake Keccak-256)
- Some current events:
  - Forbes is reporting that the [IRS Says It Will Not Tax Unsold, Staked Crypto](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kamranrosen/2022/02/02/in-huge-precedent-irs-says-it-will-not-tax-unsold-staked-crypto/?sh=135dbc5f464c)

  - There is a [Bipartisan Bill to Eliminate Taxes for Small Bitcoin Transactions](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bipartisan-bill-to-eliminate-taxes-for-small-bitcoin-transactions)
    - If the capital gains are $200 or less
    - [Here](https://www.thebharatexpressnews.com/us-lawmakers-reintroduce-bill-to-prevent-irs-from-taxing-crypto-transactions-under-200/) is another article on this
- We *almost* finished [encryption](../slides/encryption.html#/)
  - We saw random number generation and most of hashing
  - We ended on [encryption slide 9.21](../slides/encryption.html#/8/20)
  - I added a [slide on security level](../slides/encryption.html#/6/25)

- BTC reward includes transaction fees
  - See the latest block [here](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer)
- Inflation versus deflation re: BTC growth
- Mining
  - The reward address prevents using a mining pool but submitting it yourself
- "Ledger", meaning non-mined transactions, is my term for clarity, and not an official term
  - It's actually called 'mempool' -- the pool of transactions still in memory (as opposed to in a block)

## Recap: Bitcoin terms
- Wallet: a set of public/private key pairs
- Bitcoin address: the public key of one of those key pairs
- Node: a machine that takes part in the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network
  - The BTC node software looks like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Bitcoin-core-v0.10.0.png)
- Ledger: the transactions that have just occurred, and have not yet become "official"
- Block: a list of transactions that have occurred "officially", along with the hash of the previous block
- Blockchain: all the blocks
  - BTC is at about 720,000 blocks in the blockchain
  - Ethereum is at about 1.4 million blocks in the blockchain
- Miner: we'll get to that, but it's typically NOT a node
