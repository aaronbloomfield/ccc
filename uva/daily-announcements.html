## Recap
- We nailed ECDSA to the wall
  - Recall that a 256-bit ECDSA signature is considered about as hard to crack as a 3072-bit RSA signature
  - We skipped the [how to encode ECDSA points](../slides/encryption.html#/6/8)

## Corrections & Clarifications
- BTC reward includes transaction fees
  - See the latest block [here](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer)
- Inflation versus deflation re: BTC growth
- Mining
  - The reward address prevents using a mining pool but submitting it yourself
- "Ledger", meaning non-mined transactions, is my term for clarity, and not an official term
  - It's actually called 'mempool' -- the pool of transactions still in memory (as opposed to in a block)
  - You can see it's size [here](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer)

## Recap: Bitcoin terms
- Wallet: a set of public/private key pairs
- Bitcoin address: the public key of one of those key pairs
- Node: a machine that takes part in the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network
  - The BTC node software looks like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Bitcoin-core-v0.10.0.png)
- Ledger: the transactions that have just occurred, and have not yet become "official"
- Block: a list of transactions that have occurred "officially", along with the hash of the previous block
- Blockchain: all the blocks
  - BTC is at about 720,000 blocks in the blockchain
  - Ethereum is at about 1.4 million blocks in the blockchain
- Miner: we'll get to that, but it's typically NOT a node
