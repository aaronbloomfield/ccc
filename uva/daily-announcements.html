## Lecture 9: Mon, Sep 10th
- [BTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD): `$`25,719; [ETH](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD): `$`1,610; [ETH gas](https://etherscan.io/gastracker): 9 gwei => `$`0.30
- Office hours are in full swing, and are on the [Canvas landing page](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/72253)
- Homeworks
  - [HW P2: ECDSA](../hws/ecdsa/index.html) is out and due next Tue, Sep 12th
    - It's ready, and we'll go over it today after we see the relevant lecture material
  - HW S3 will be a reading, and will be due late next week; details on Wednesday
- Canvas now has anonymous feedback!
- Grading
  - HW S1: Google Survey is graded
    - As its not a Gradescope assignment, it's in Canvas' Posted Feedback; everybody got a 10/10
  - [HW P1: Cryptocurrency Introductory](../hws/intro/index.html) grades have been released; avg was 8.26
    - We'll talk about regrade requests on the next slide
  - HWs S2 (BTC quiz) is out being graded; will likely take 1-2 weeks
- Upcoming HWs (not yet ready!)
  - HW P3 (due Tue, Sep 19th) will be on Bitcoin's blockchain, and will be out Wednesday
  - HW P4 (due Tue, Sep 26th) will be on Bitcoin scripting
- You will need to have a working laptop/notebook computer in about 2 weeks
  - You'll have to bring it to class a few times
  - Don't have one?  Let's chat, as the CS dept can loan you one
- Today we will start on [Bitcoin](../slides/bitcoin.html#/), which will take us into next week



## Regrades
- All programming assignments are auto-graded; written "things" (exams and quizzes) are not
- If your auto-graded assignment got a low score due to:
  - An auto-grader failure
  - A genuine mis-understanding of the assignment due to poor wording on our part
  - A set of auto-grader tests that you do not think were fair
- Then you can submit a regrade
- You cannot submit a regrade for:
  - Getting it wrong
  - Wanting more points
  - Your dog eating your homework
- To do so, submit a support request within *1 week* of when it's returned
  - If you do it 8 days later, I'm probably not going to care
  - But 2 weeks later?  No dice
  - In the support request, explain why you feel you should get more points
- This applies to all graded items in this course other than the final
  - Due to that being the end of the semester, it has a shorter time period, but I'll make sure everybody knows about it at that point
- Regrade support requests for exams/quizzes typically stalled and handled at the *very end of the semester*
