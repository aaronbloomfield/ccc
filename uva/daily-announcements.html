## Lecture 35: Mon, Nov 13th
- [BTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD): `$`37,123; [ETH](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD): `$`2,051; [ETH gas](https://etherscan.io/gastracker): 34 gwei => `$`1.47 @ 2023-11-12 21:35:32
  - Let's check how our [silly ape NFT](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/7537) is doing
- Office hours are in full swing, and are on the [Canvas landing page](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/72253) (My Wed are now 1-2)
- Homeworks
  - [HW P8: DEX](../hws/dex/index.html) grades were returned last night: average was 6.56
    - Oof!  I don't think there was an auto-grader error, but there might have been, so let me know
  - [HW P9: DAO & web3](../hws/daoweb3.html) is out, and due tomorrow (Tuesday, Nov 14th)
    - The necessary info is on the Canvas landing page
  - No homework due Nov 21, since it's Thanksgiving week
  - HW P10: Arbitrage will be due Nov 28, and will be out late this week
  - HW P11: Metamask will be due Dec 5
- Canvas now has anonymous feedback!
- Grading: everything in Gradescope is graded and returned!
  - Regrades are not yet handled, and likely won't be until the very end of the semester
  - Note that the DAO&web3 assignment requires human grading, and that will take quite some time
- Today we will continue with [Stablecoins](../slides/stablecoins.html#/), starting on slide 6.1
  - Next up: [Consensus](../slides/consensus.html#/)



## Final exam
- The final exam is Tuesday, December 12th, from 9am to noon
  - It cannot be taken early nor can it be taken late
  - Those with SDAC accommodations: you will still need to take it with the rest of the course, and I'll be sure to provide those accommodations
    - Meaning you should *NOT* take it at the SDAC office
- It will have a *practical* component, in addition to a written test
- For the practical component:
  - You will need to show up with a notebook computer that you ran [HW S4 (ethprivate)](../hws/ethprivate/index.html) and [HW S5 (dappintro)](../hws/dappintro/index.html) on
  - If you are going to use a different eth.coinbase there than you have used in any previous assignment, let me know
    - This can be done during the exam as well
  - The written will be at the start, and it will clearly indicate when you should switch over to using your notebook
- How to study for the practical component?
  - As long as you did the homeworks, and understood the basics of Solidity programming and using Remix, you should be fine

## Regrades
- All programming assignments are auto-graded; written "things" (exams and quizzes) are not
- If your auto-graded assignment got a low score due to:
  - An auto-grader failure
  - A genuine mis-understanding of the assignment due to poor wording on our part
  - A set of auto-grader tests that you do not think were fair
- Then you can submit a regrade
- You cannot submit a regrade for:
  - Getting it wrong
  - Wanting more points
  - Your dog eating your homework
- To do so, submit a support request within *1 week* of when it's returned
  - If you do it 8 days later, I'm probably not going to care
  - But 2 weeks later?  No dice
  - In the support request, explain why you feel you should get more points
- This applies to all graded items in this course other than the final
  - Due to that being the end of the semester, it has a shorter time period, but I'll make sure everybody knows about it at that point
- Regrade support requests for exams/quizzes typically stalled and handled at the *very end of the semester*
