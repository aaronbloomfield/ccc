## Name our cryptocurrency!
- This will be a question on the midterm
- We are using a (private and fake) version of Ethereum
  - But what should we call it?
- Previous names:
  - Spring 2022: Faether ("fake ether")
  - Fall 2022: Hoothereum
- You should have one "good" name for our cryptocurrency
  - "Good" means take a few minutes to think of one
  - You are welcome to have a few, but only one is needed for full credit
  - No extra points for multiple names...
- It can't be a [name that is already taken](https://coinmarketcap.com/)

This slide used to contain a Dilbert comic by Scott Adams.  But after his recent [racist rant](https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2023/02/25/scott-adams-dilbert-canceled/) in late February 2023, and then realizing the [type of person he is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Adams#Views), all Dilbert comics have been removed.
