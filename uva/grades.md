Cryptocurrency: Course grades
=============================

[Go up to the CCC UVA page](index.html) ([md](index.md))

As per the [syllabus](syllabus.html) ([md](syllabus.md)), the grades were computed by:

- Programming and written assignments (50%)
- Midterm (15%)
- Final exam (20%)
- Class participation, pop quizzes (15%)

## Grade computation

- The Programming and written assignments average included all of the P homeworks as well as the non-quiz S homeworks (S1, S4, and S5).  The P homeworks were weighted at twice the amount of the S homeworks.
- Class participation, pop quizzes
	- The quiz average was from the two quizzes (S2 & S3), as well as participation in the Debts example (full credit if you participated)
	- The attendance grade was weighted equally as each other, and an excused day was considered the same as being present
	- The overall participation grade was two parts attendance and 1 part quiz grade
- The course average was based on the formula above
- The course curve was 3 points -- so add 3 points to your overall course average, and then match that on the standard decade curve (shown below).
	- You can round up if necessary


| Cut-off | Letter grade |
|----|----|
| 0	 | F  |

| 63 | D  |
