Readings
--------

<!-- All scholarly articles (such as from the ACM digital library) can be obtained from free from any UVA wireless network.  Some of them you will *NOT* be able to get it for free from your home Internet provider such as Comcast (unless you live in a UVA dorm, of course) without using a UVA VPN.  -->

All readings are due by the start of lecture that day.  You should expect there to be in-class quizzes on each reading.

- Due early February (date TBA): HW S2: Read the [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/) ([PDF](https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/bitcoin.pdf)) (also in Canvas [here](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/files/981134/download?download_frd=1))

<!--

- Due Wed, 9/28: HW S3: read (some of) the [Ethereum whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/) ([PDF](https://blockchainlab.com/pdf/Ethereum_white_paper-a_next_generation_smart_contract_and_decentralized_application_platform-vitalik-buterin.pdf)) (also in Collab [here](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/access/content/group/e9ad2fbb-faca-414b-9df1-6f9019e765e9/ethereum-whitepaper.pdf))
    - You can skip (or quickly browse) the first 3 sub-parts of the 'History' section ('Bitcoin', 'Mining', and 'Merkle Trees'); also skip the 'references and further reading' section at the end; what's left is 24 pages in the PDF to read
