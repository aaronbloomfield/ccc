Readings
--------

<!-- All scholarly articles (such as from the ACM digital library) can be obtained from free from any UVA wireless network.  Some of them you will *NOT* be able to get it for free from your home Internet provider such as Comcast (unless you live in a UVA dorm, of course) without using a UVA VPN.  -->

All readings are due by the start of lecture that day.  You should expect there to be in-class quizzes on each reading.

  - Due Friday, February 17th: HW S3: Read the [Ethereum whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/) ([PDF](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/59096/files?preview=1043863))
      - You can skip (or quickly browse) the first 3 sub-parts of the ‘History’ section (‘Bitcoin’, ‘Mining’, and ‘Merkle Trees’); also skip the ‘references and further reading’ section at the end; what’s left is 32 pages (of large and widely-spaced text) in the PDF to read
      - Be sure you do ***NOT*** read the [outdated PDF](https://ethereum.org/669c9e2e2027310b6b3cdce6e1c52962/Ethereum_Whitepaper_-_Buterin_2014.pdf), which is what a lot of searches for "ethereum whitepaper pdf" will return
- Due Friday, February 3rd: HW S2: Read the [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/) ([PDF](https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/bitcoin.pdf)) (also in Canvas [here](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/files/981134/download?download_frd=1))
