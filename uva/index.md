Readings
--------

All scholarly articles (such as from the ACM digital library) can be obtained from free from any UVa wireless network.  Some of them you will *NOT* be able to get it for free from your home Internet provider such as Comcast (unless you live in a UVa dorm, of course) without using a UVa VPN.  All readings are due by the start of lecture that day.  You should expect there to be in-class quizzes on each reading.

<!--

    - You can skip (or quickly browse) the first 3 sub-parts of the 'History' section ('Bitcoin', 'Mining', and 'Merkle Trees'); also skip the 'references and further reading' section at the end; what's left is 24 pages in the PDF to read

## Legal Issues

This course has received approval from the necessary parts of UVA: [ITS](https://virginia.service-now.com/its/), [InfoSec](https://security.virginia.edu/), and the [Office of the University Counsel](https://universitycounsel.virginia.edu/).  Specifically, the cryptocurrencies created in this course will be exchangeable with each other, but not with any cryptocurrency outside the course; thus they have no monetary value.  Because they have no monetary value, and because the activities in this course are necessary to achieve the academic goals of the course, these various activities of this course, including mining, have been judged to be legal.
