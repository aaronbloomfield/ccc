## Legal Issues

This course has received approval from the necessary parts of UVA: [ITS](https://virginia.service-now.com/its/), [InfoSec](https://security.virginia.edu/), and the [Office of the University Counsel](https://universitycounsel.virginia.edu/).  Specifically, the cryptocurrencies created in this course will be exchangeable with each other, but not with any cryptocurrency outside the course; thus they have no monetary value.  Because they have no monetary value, and because the activities in this course are necessary to achieve the academic goals of the course, these various activities of this course, including mining, have been judged to be legal.
