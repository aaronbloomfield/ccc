<!-- All scholarly articles (such as from the ACM digital library) can be obtained from free from any UVA wireless network.

All readings are due by the start of lecture that day.  You should expect there to be in-class quizzes on each reading.

  - Due Friday, February 17th: HW S3: Read the [Ethereum whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/) ([PDF](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/72253/files?preview=1043863))
      - You can skip (or quickly browse) the first 3 sub-parts of the ‘History’ section (‘Bitcoin’, ‘Mining’, and ‘Merkle Trees’); also skip the ‘references and further reading’ section at the end; what’s left is 32 pages (of large and widely-spaced text) in the PDF to read
      - Be sure you do ***NOT*** read the [outdated PDF](https://ethereum.org/669c9e2e2027310b6b3cdce6e1c52962/Ethereum_Whitepaper_-_Buterin_2014.pdf), which is what a lot of searches for "ethereum whitepaper pdf" will return
- Due Friday, February 3rd: HW S2: Read the [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/) ([PDF](https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/bitcoin.pdf)) (also in Canvas [here](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/files/981134/download?download_frd=1))

This course has received approval from the necessary parts of UVA: [ITS](https://virginia.service-now.com/its/), [InfoSec](https://security.virginia.edu/), and the [Office of the University Counsel](https://universitycounsel.virginia.edu/).  Specifically, the cryptocurrencies created in this course will be exchangeable with each other, but not with any cryptocurrency outside the course; thus they have no monetary value.
