will be exchangeable with each other, but not with any cryptocurrency
outside the course; thus they have no monetary value. Because they have
no monetary value, and because the activities in this course are
necessary to achieve the academic goals of the course, these various
activities of this course, including mining, have been judged to be
legal.</p>
