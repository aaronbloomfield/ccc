<p><a href="../index.html">Go up to the CCC HW page</a> (<a
href="../index.md">md</a>)</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>This homework will take you through the process of compiling,
deploying, and running a decentralized application (dApp) on our private
Ethereum blockchain. This assignment does not focus on the programming
aspects of Solidity – that’s in a future assignment, as well as the
lectures.</p>
<p>Giving credit where credit is due: The particular smart contract
being used here was inspired by the one in <a
href="https://github.com/dappuniversity/election">this github repo</a>
by Dapp University (disclaimer: they are not an actual accredited
university; but they do have great online tutorials).</p>
<h3 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>You will have to have completed the <a
href="../ethprivate/index.html">connecting to the private Ethereum
blockchain</a> assignment. You should have a few (fake) ETH. For some of
the tasks below you will need to launch your geth node, connecting to
the course server, and start up a geth Javascript terminal; how to do
all that is all described in the <a
href="../ethprivate/index.html">connecting to the private Ethereum
blockchain</a> assignment. You will also need to launch a geth terminal,
which is also described in the that assignment.</p>
<p>If you have not successfully completed the <a
href="../ethprivate/index.html">connecting to the private Ethereum
blockchain</a> assignment then you will not be able to complete this
assignment.</p>
<p>Warning to Mac OS X users: there is one part in this assignment that
Safari seems to have issues with. This part is indicated when you get to
it, and you may have to switch to a different browser (Firefox or
Chrome) to complete that part.</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>To deploy and run a smart contract, you need to be able to the
standard development tasks – editing, compilation, and testing. The last
one – testing – is tricky, as you have to be running in an environment
that simulates a blockchain and (fake) accounts with (fake) ETH. Once
it’s compiled, you have to then be able to load it onto the blockchain,
whether that blockchain is simulated (for testing) or real (for
deployment).</p>
<p>For the development tasks, we are going to use <a
href="http://remix.ethereum.org">Remix</a>, which is an IDE designed
specifically for Solidity smart contracts on an Ethereum blockchain. You
can use it online at <a
href="http://remix.ethereum.org">remix.ethereum.org</a>, or you can
download the latest version on your computer via <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/remix-desktop/releases">remix’s github
repo</a>. Each method has it’s pros and cons. The online site is quick
to use, doesn’t require installation, but does not save your changes –
you have to save it locally, or edit it locally and then copy/paste it
into Remix. If you do want to go this route, we suggest editing your
code with <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">sublime</a> with the <a
href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Ethereum">Ethereum package</a>
installed. The other option – installing Remix locally – requires going
through the installation process, but makes it easier to develop
locally. We recommend the latter (download and install), but the choice
is yours. The directions herein will apply to both options. Note that
all of these tools (the Remix IDE and Sublime with the Ethereum package)
are already installed on the VirtualBox image. Remix’s source code is <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project">available on
github</a>, and it is <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/blob/master/LICENSE">released
under the MIT license</a>; some of the Remix images are included
herein.</p>
<p>Remix allows you to develop, compile, and test your code on a
simulated blockchain with fake accounts. It cannot, all by itself,
deploy to a blockchain. For that, we are going to use geth. We will
connect Remix to geth for our deployment, and geth will be the conduit
to deploy to the blockchain. More on that later in this assignment.</p>
<p>There are many different tool chains that one can use to compile and
deploy smart contracts – Truffle and Ganache, command-line compilation
with solc and deployment with geth, etc. We had to pick one, and Remix
seemed the most logical choice. We will see how to interact with the
blockchain through geth in an in-class activity in the <a
href="../../slides/solidity.html#/">Solidity lecture slide set</a>.</p>
<p>The same process described herein can be used to deploy on the real
Ethereum blockchain. The only difference is that you would run geth to
connect to the real Ethereum blockchain, rather than our private course
blockchain. Everything else stays the same.</p>
<h3 id="code-base">Code base</h3>
<p>For this assignment we will be providing the Solidity code to use: <a
href="Choices.sol.html">Choices.sol</a> (<a href="Choices.sol">src</a>).
The code will allow voting for <em>something</em> via the blockchain –
an election, your favorite color, or anything else. Election dApps are
fairly common as first examples of Solidity programs. Note that while
you should be able to gain a rough idea of what is going on in the code,
the tasks herein are not to understand the code, but to be able to
compile and deploy it. Understanding the code, and writing your own, is
in the next assignment and upcoming course lectures (one of the lectures
will even go over this exact code base).</p>
<p>That being said, you will need to make a small modification to the
code. Edit the <a href="Choices.sol.html">Choices.sol</a> (<a
href="Choices.sol">src</a>) file to add your own Choices. In particular,
you should ONLY change the <code>addChoices()</code> calls in the
constructor – you can add more or take some away, as needed. It is
important that you do not change any other code in the contract, else it
will not work properly when we are testing and grading it! Please choose
something that is not controversial – there are many great ways to fight
for, and to voice opinions for, things that others may find
controversial. Our private Ethereum blockchain for this course is not
one of them.</p>
<h3 id="task-1-use-remix">Task 1: Use Remix</h3>
<p>Remix is the IDE for developing Ethereum smart contracts in Solidity.
Remix provides easy to read compiler error messages and makes it really
easy to test your smart contract as you are developing it. You can
either use the online editor at <a
href="http://remix.ethereum.org">remix.ethereum.org</a> or you can
install it locally via the <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/remix-desktop/releases">Remix download
page</a>. It is already installed on the VirtualBox image. The web
interface on <a href="http://remix.ethereum.org">remix.ethereum.org</a>
is designed to look just like the IDE, and you are welcome to use either
– the directions herein apply the same to both. However, if you do use
the web interface, make sure you save your text file back to your
computer.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Load up Remix. The far left column has four icons at the top – the
Remix logo (<img src="img/remixLogo.webp" class='icon'>), the file
explorer icon (<img src="img/fileManager.webp" class='icon'>), the
compilation icon (<img src="img/solidityLogo.webp" class='icon'>), and
the deploy &amp; run icon
(<img src="img/deployAndRun.webp" class='icon'>). At various times in
this tutorial, you may see a debugging icon
(<img src="img/debuggerLogo.webp" class='icon'>) beneath these four, but
we are not going to focus on the debugger in this assignment. On the
bottom are two more icons – the plugin manager
(<img src="img/pluginManager.webp" class='icon'>) and settings
(<img src="img/settings.webp" class='icon'>).</li>
<li>Click on the file explorer icon
(<img src="img/fileManager.webp" class='icon'>), right click on the
contracts folder, and select ‘New File’ – name it ‘Choices.sol’. Copy
and paste the <a href="Choices.sol.html">Choices.sol</a> (<a
href="Choices.sol">src</a>) program there.</li>
<li>Next we are going to compile it – click on the compilation icon
(<img src="img/solidityLogo.webp" class='icon'>). You may notice a green
check mark on the compilation icon – it might automatically compile it
as you type (this does not seem to be consistent across all platforms).
Click on the compilation icon, and click “Compile Choices.sol”. It
should compile without errors.
<ul>
<li>Remix does allow for compiler optimizations, but we are not going to
explore them in this assignment. For now, don’t select any optimizations
(meaning leave it as the default options).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Click on the “deploy &amp; run” icon
(<img src="img/deployAndRun.webp" class='icon'>). For the Environment,
we will stay with “Javascript VM (London)”, which means that Remix will
simulate, in Javascript, a fake Ethereum blockchain and 10 fake accounts
for us. You can see the accounts in the ‘Account’ drop-down list.</li>
<li>Click the orange “Deploy” button. It’s now running on the
(simulated) Ethereum blockchain, deployed from the selected (and also
simulated) account shown in the “Account” drop-down list.</li>
<li>Test out the deployment
<ul>
<li>Look under “Deployed Contracts”, below the “Deploy” button – click
on the arrow to the left of “Choices at …”. It will show you various
buttons to test out your smart contract.</li>
<li>Click on “num_choices”. The console (under the code window; you can
make it bigger to see what’s going on) will state, “call to
Choices.num_choices”. The line below that will have a “Debug” button and
a down arrow – click on that arrow. In the various items that appear,
you will see a “decoded output” field that lists the number of choices
for this smart contract.</li>
<li>The “choices” button requires a number – put any valid number in
there (non-negative and less than the number of choices), and click that
button. Again, if you expand the returned result, under “decoded
output”, you will see the values in the Choice struct that was returned.
Note the number of votes is 0.</li>
<li>Let’s vote! Pick the same option you picked above, enter that value
into the box. Then click on the orange “vote” button.
<ul>
<li>Note that this button is orange, whereas the others are blue. Orange
indicates that it has to send a transaction to the blockchain, and that
transaction has to be mined into the blockchain before it takes effect.
The blue buttons are read-only, and do not require mining a transaction
into the blockchain. Fortunately, this simulated environment will
auto-mine that transaction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>View the output. You’ll notice that there is nothing in the “decoded
output” field (this method basically had a <code>void</code> return
type), but there is now a “transaction hash” field. Because it was a
(simulated) transaction, the transaction hash is reported back.</li>
<li>Pull up the data on that choice (enter the same choice number next
to “choices”, and click that blue “choices” button). You will notice
that the number of votes is now 1.</li>
<li>Try to vote again, for any choice. Notice that it doesn’t work – the
console states that “The transaction has been reverted to the initial
state”. This particular smart contract prevents double-voting. It does
this by keeping track of who has voted (in the <code>voters</code>
mapping on line 14), and then ensuring that the current voter has not
already voted (the first line of the <code>vote()</code> method via a
<code>require()</code> call). If a <code>require()</code> call fails,
then the state of everything is reverted back to what it was before the
transaction occurs (although you still lose your gas fees).</li>
<li>Switch accounts (choose a different one in the drop-down list under
“Account”), and try to vote – this time it will work, since that (new)
account number has not already voted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Explore compilation again
<ul>
<li>Click on the compilation icon
(<img src="img/solidityLogo.webp" class='icon'>). At the bottom of the
left pane click on “Compilation Details”. This is showing all the
results of the compilation.</li>
<li>Expand the ‘bytecode’ button. There is a lot here, and we can ignore
most of it. Scroll down to the very bottom of what just appeared – the
two fields we care about are the “object” field and the “opcodes”
field.</li>
<li>The bytecode -&gt; opcodes field are the Ethereum bytecode that the
smart contract was compiled down to. This is similar in concept to the
Bitcoin Script, although it has the ability to perform looks (via
<code>JUMP</code> commands and similar), and is a lot more complex.</li>
<li>The Bytecode -&gt; object field is the raw hex of the compiled
program itself – the bytecodes were compiled to their hexadecimal
equivalents. This very long string (over 4,000 bytes) is what is
actually loaded onto the blockchain. When we deploy our code to the
blockchain, below, you will be able to see that bytecode in the
transaction.</li>
<li>Back in the left-hand pane, under the “Compilation Details” button
is a link to copy the ABI – click on the copy icon. In any editor, paste
that into a blank file. This is the Application Binary Interface – it
specifies how to interact with the smart contract. Think of it like a
C++ header file – it gives the interface, but not the implementation.
One cannot interact with a smart contract without having the ABI. As you
scroll through the ABI, you will notice that all the fields and method
are listed there, along with all the various types.
<ul>
<li><strong>THIS IS IMPORTANT!</strong> In future assignments, when you
are going to write your own smart contracts, you will need to submit the
ABI for each of them along with the source code. Without the ABI, we
will not be able to interact with your smart contract!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Explore Remix on your own. You are going to be spending a lot of
time developing smart contracts in Remix. Spending a bit of time
learning how it works, and becoming comfortable with the interface, will
save you a lot of time in the future.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="task-2-deployment-from-remix">Task 2: Deployment from Remix</h3>
<p>At this point we can edit, compile, and test our program on Remix. We
have also made changes to the <code>addChoice()</code> calls in the
Choices.sol constructor. Now we are going to use Remix to deploy to our
private Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<h4 id="start-geth">Start geth</h4>
<p>We need to start geth, as we did in the <a
href="../ethprivate/index.html">connecting to the private Ethereum
blockchain</a> assignment. However, we need to add a few more
command-line parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--http</code>: This enables the HTTP-RPC server. What this
means is that it will open a port (8545) that programs – in our case,
Remix – can connect to to interact with geth (and, eventually, deploy to
the blockchain)
<ul>
<li>RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call. It’s a way for one program to
call a procedure running in some other program. In this case, the client
is trying to call the procedure, and the geth node is receiving, and
then executing, the procedure call.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>--http.corsdomain="https://remix.ethereum.org"</code>: This
allows that particular site to connect to the HTTP-RPC server. Normally
all sites are blocked for security reasons, so we have to specifically
grant permission for individual sites to connect.
<ul>
<li><strong>NOTE:</strong> if you are using the Remix IDE, you will have
to enter some other value instead of
<code>https://remix.ethereum.org</code>; the pop-up window in Remix
(that pop-up window is described below) will tell you what the value is.
For now, use the the flag as specified here, and know that you will have
to make a change to it below; the assignment steps below will tell you
when and how.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>--http.api web3,eth,debug,personal,net</code>: These are the
APIs that are made available on the HTTP-RPC server. For example, by
enabling <code>eth</code> (one of the ones listed), then
<code>eth.blockNumber</code> can be called. This is only for the
HTTP-RPC server; an attached geth node has access to all the APIs.</li>
<li><code>--vmdebug</code>: This records information useful for
debugging, which is an option that Remix will allow us to do.</li>
<li><code>--allow-insecure-unlock</code>: This will allow us to unlock
our <code>eth.coinbase</code> account via
<code>personal.unlockAccount()</code>. Normally this is disabled if the
HTTP-RPC server is enabled. Our particular configuration does not allow
any <em>other</em> machines to connect to the HTTP-RPC server, and our
(fake) ETH is not worth any money, so it is safe enough for us to use
for this course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our full geth call will look like the following. Recall that you have
to change the <code>/path/to/ethprivate</code> path to match your
directory, and you have to change the chainID (aka the networkid) to
match the one for our private Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<pre><code>geth --datadir /path/to/ethprivate --networkid 12345678 --maxpeers 1 --http --http.corsdomain=&quot;https://remix.ethereum.org&quot; \
     --http.api web3,eth,debug,personal,net --vmdebug --allow-insecure-unlock</code></pre>
<p>The backslash (<code>\</code>) is to handle word wrap on the page –
those two lines work on Linux and Mac OS X, but you may have to put it
all on one line (removing the backslash (<code>\</code>) in Windows.
This will start the local node. In particular, you will see a line that
says, “HTTP server started”, which is what our additional options did.
Note that these particular options will only allow Remix that is running
– either as a stand-alone IDE or through the browswer – <em>on the same
machine</em> to connect. So you can’t run geth in VirtualBox (or on
Amazon AWS) and Remix on your host machine, for example.</p>
<p>Now that geth is started, we have to attach to it IN A SEPARATE
WINDOW via <code>geth attach /path/to/geth.ipc</code> (or, in Windows,
either <code>geth attach ipc:\\\\.\\pipe\\geth.ipc</code> or <code>geth
attach \\.\pipe\geth.ipc</code>). Wait for it to finish sync’ing (check
<code>eth.syncing</code>). Then <code>eth.blockNumber</code> should
(more or less) match the highest block number on our Ethereum blockchain
explorer.</p>
<p>Just to check: at this point, you should have TWO geth processes
running in separate windows. The first is the full node with the various
<code>--http</code> options. The second is a geth terminal via
<code>geth attach</code>.</p>
<h4 id="configure-remix">Configure Remix</h4>
<p>You should have Choices.sol loaded into Remix, and you should have
made the modifications to the <code>addChoices()</code> calls in the
constructor. You should have compiled it WITHOUT optimizations.</p>
<p>Read these instructions through before starting them!</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Change to the Remix deployment tab.
<ul>
<li>Under ‘Environment’ select “Web3 Provider”. The pop-up window will
tell you the options to run geth with, and you have already done that,
above. Ensure that the “Web3 Provider Endpoint”, in the pop-up box, says
<code>http://127.0.0.1:8545</code>.
<ul>
<li>If you are using the Remix IDE, the pop-up window in Remix will tell
you what you should use as your endpoint value (meaning what value to
put after the <code>--http.corsdomain</code> flag). You should restart
the geth node with that flag.</li>
<li>Click OK to close that pop-up window</li>
<li>Note to Mac OS X users: if you are doing this assignment on
remix.etherem.org in Safari, then this is the part that Safari seems to
have issues with. If it is not working for you, then please switch to a
different browser (Firefox or Chrome both seem to work fine). You can
then cut-and-paste your code from Remix in Safari to remix in Firefox /
Chrome.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Underneath the “Environment” drop-down box, it should now say,
“Custom (12345678) network”, with the chain number of our private
blockchain instead of 12345678.</li>
<li>You should see your geth account address(es) populated in the
“Account” drop-down box, with your <code>eth.coinbase</code> one
selected</li>
<li>If there are any entries listed under “Deployed contracts” (in the
left-hand pane), you can delete them – this way we won’t mix up any
previous deployments with the one we are about to do</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Unlock your account in geth
<ul>
<li>In the geth terminal, run the <code>personal.unlockAccount()</code>
command. You can run it as
<code>personal.unlockAccount(eth.coinbase,"password",0)</code> – filling
in your own password – to unlock it until the end of the session. It
should report back <code>true</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hit Deploy!
<ul>
<li>This what this party is all about! Click the orange Deploy
button.</li>
<li>The Remix console (under the editing box) should say, “creation of
Choices pending… view on etherscan”</li>
<li>Note that this submitted it as a transaction, but it is not (yet) in
the blockchain</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mine it into the blockchain
<ul>
<li>In real Ethereum, we would have to wait a bit for it to be mined
into the blockchain. But we can do that ourselves on our private
Ethereum blockchain.</li>
<li>In the geth console, run <code>txpool.status</code> to see how many
pending transactions there are. And view that transaction via
<code>eth.pendingTransactions</code>
<ul>
<li>Note that if other students are running through this tutorial at the
same time you are, they may end up mining it into the blockchain for
you, and perhaps even before you can view it via those commands</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make a note of the blocknumber via <code>eth.blockNumber</code> and
your balance in (fake) ETH via
<code>web3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(eth.coinbase), "ether")</code></li>
<li>Mine it into the blockchain via <code>miner.start()</code>, wait a
few seconds, then enter <code>miner.stop()</code>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that the block number has increased via your mining – if
the difficulty is too high, then it may take a bit longer to mine</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>See what happened
<ul>
<li>Look at your new balance via
<code>web3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(eth.coinbase), "ether")</code>. One
would normally expect that gas fees are deducted. However, our gas is
set so low (possibly to zero), and you are mining to get it into the
blockchain, that you balance will actually have gone <em>up</em>.
<ul>
<li>Look back at the Remix console – it will say something like,
<code>[block:12345 txIndex:0] from: 0x123...bcdef to:
Choices.(constructor) value: 0 wei data: 0x608...57221 logs: 0 hash:
0x123...bcdef</code>
<ul>
<li>Save the block number (shown in the previous line as 12345), as you
will need to submit that</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Click on the arrow to the right of the “Debug” button in the console
– this will list the details of the transaction that was mined into the
blockchain</li>
<li>Make a note of the transaction hash, as you will need to submit that
value as well</li>
<li>The <em>contract address</em> is listed in the left-hand pane, under
the deploy button (in the “Deployed Contracts”) section)
<ul>
<li>Save the contract address – there is a copy icon to easily copy it –
as you will need to submit that</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can view the information for that transaction on our blockchain
explorer – the block that contained the transaction that deployed your
smart contract, the transaction itself, and the account that is the
contract address
<ul>
<li>You may have to wait up to 5 minutes for the explorer to
refresh</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Call some methods on your contract
<ul>
<li>If you expand the specific deployed contract, you can see the
various methods that it provides. Call the blue buttoned methods, which
are the ones that are read-only methods (and thus do not require writing
a transaction to the blockchain) – choices, num_choices, voters, and
unnecessaryFunction.
<ul>
<li>To see if you have voted, click the copy icon to the right of your
account drop-down box, then paste that into the ‘voters’ box and click
‘voters’ – it should show false, but you will have to click on the down
arrow to the right of the ‘debug’ button that appeared</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Vote for your choice! Enter a number in the ‘vote’ box for your
choice, and click ‘vote’ - You will see “transact to Choices.vote
pending …” in the console – it’s waiting for the transaction to make it
onto the blockchain - Run <code>miner.start()</code> and then
<code>miner.stop()</code> - In the console, click the down-arrow to the
right of the ‘debug’ button that appeared – it lists the transaction
hash. You can view that on the explorer as well - You will need to
submit the block number and transaction hash where you voted</li>
<li>You can call ‘voters’ again with your coinbase account; it should
return true this time</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don’t close down Remix!
<ul>
<li>You are going to need it open and with the Choices.sol compiled, for
task 4, below</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="task-3-view-a-web-page">Task 3: View a web page</h3>
<p>We wanted to show you that you can create a web page to interact with
a smart contract on the blockchain. The Javascript of the web page uses
the web3 library, which is what allows you to connect to the blockchain
from Javascript. In our case, we use it to connect to a node running
geth. The URL for this web page is on the Collab landing page – once
there, enter your smart contract’s contract address (with the leading
<code>0x</code>) for your deployed smart contract, and it will display
the choices.</p>
<p>On the course blockchain explorer, you can find other contract
addresses – look at the transactions page, and see what has something
listed in the ‘contract address’ column. You can then enter that address
into the web page to see what choices your classmates selected. Note
that you won’t know who deployed that particular smart contract. Note
that this web page will only work with the version of the Choices code
shown here, and only if there are no compilation optimizations.
Specifically, it will only work with a smart contract that has the same
ABI that the Choices.sol generates; you can see that ABI in the
Javascript source code of the web page. Some of the earlier contracts on
the blockchain are earlier versions of Choices.sol or different
contracts. But most of the recent ones should work.</p>
<p>How this all works is beyond the scope of this assignment, but will
be something we will be going over later in the semester. Feel free to
look over the Javascript code in that web page – the only other
requirement is that a local geth node has to be running with a few
specific flags to enable this web page to connect to it. One can also
have a web page initiate a transaction onto the blockchain, such as
casting a vote – we will see that later as well; that requires a browser
plugin, such as <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a>, that allows
for posting of transactions from a web page using a specific Ethereum
account.</p>
<h3 id="task-4-vote">Task 4: Vote!</h3>
<p>I have loaded the Choices smart contract onto our private Ethereum
blockchain, and you all must vote! The only information I will tell you
is that the contract address for this is on the Collab landing page.
It’s the same Choices.sol code that we have been using throughout this
assignment, albeit with different choices. You have to figure out what
the options are, and then vote for one. You will need to submit the
block number and transaction hash where you voted.</p>
<p>In Remix, you can call a different contract <em>with the same
codebase</em>. In particular, it has to have the same ABI. On the Collab
landing page is the address of a deployed Choices contract – copy that
address. In Remix, above the “Deployed contracts” list is a blue “At
Address” button – copy the contract address there, and click that
button. This now gives us a connection to a different Choices contract.
Use this to vote. Remember that you have to mine your vote to the
blockchain for it to take effect.</p>
<p>Note that Remix may complain that the address is not <a
href="../../slides/ethereum.html#/checksum">checksummed</a>. This is a
warning, not an error, and it should still work fine. Remix will
provide, in the warning, the checksummed address – you are welcome to
use that instead to silence this warning.</p>
<p>The assumption is that the account you will vote with is your
<code>eth.coinbase</code> account. (It’s fine if you want to use a
different account, but when you submit your information at the end of
this assignment, be sure to submit the account that you used for the
deployment and voting.) As your account information will be in the
<code>voters</code> mapping, we will be able to determine who has voted
and who has not. We won’t know who voted for what, though, since that
information is not kept by this smart contract. (Well, mostly. We could
look up who voted for what, since it’s on the blockchain, but that’s a
hassle we aren’t going to do that.) You get credit for this part as
along as you vote on my smart contract; it does not matter what you vote
for.</p>

<p>Please turn off your geth node when you are done with this
assignment. You can always turn it back on again when needed.</p>
<h3 id="submission-grading">Submission &amp; Grading</h3>
<p>To test your program, we will look at your deployed Choices smart
contract on our private blockchain. We will check that you did the
various tasks (deployed the contract, modified the options, voted for an
option for your own contract, voted for an option on our contract,
etc.).</p>
<p>You will need to submit your information via a Google form, the link
to which is on the Collab landing page. You will need to submit the
following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name &amp; UVA userid</li>
<li>Your account number from <code>eth.coinbase</code>. The assumption
is that you did your tasks from this account (deployed your contract,
the votes, etc.); if you did it from a different account, submit that
account address.</li>
<li>From task 2, you should submit information about the smart contract
you deployed. If you mined it to the blockchain multiple times, that’s
fine – pick the most recent one (where you voted), and submit that one.
You should submit:
<ul>
<li>The transaction hash of the contract transaction</li>
<li>The contract address for the contract (this can be the checksummed
version or all lower-case)</li>
<li>The block number where this transaction was mined</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Also from task 2, the transaction hash and the block number where
you voted on YOUR Choices contract</li>
<li>From task 4, the transaction hash and the block number where you
voted for MY Choices contract</li>
<li>How many hours (as a floating-point number) this assignment took you
to complete. Please be honest here – I’m using this to judge workload,
and this will have no impact on your grade for this assignment.</li>
</ul>
