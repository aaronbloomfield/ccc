<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>We will be developing applications for the Ethereum blockchain. We won’t be using the actual Ethereum blockchain for a number of reasons (cost, legal issues, speed, etc.). Instead, we are going to use a private Ethereum blockchain – a test network – that has been set up for this class. This assignment is to connect to it, explore it, and perform a few operations.</p>
<h3 id="changelog">Changelog</h3>
<p>Any changes to this page will be put here for easy reference. Typo fixes and minor clarifications are not listed here. So far there aren’t any significant changes to report.</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>This document assumes that you have a recent version of Python 3 installed, and that you can install Python packages through <code>pip</code> (or <code>pip3</code>). This is already taken care of in the VirtualBox image. Don’t worry if you don’t know Python – we give you the exact code to use.</p>
<p>This document also assumes you can install packages on your machine (also not needed for the VirtualBox image).</p>
<h3 id="part-1-geth">Part 1: Geth</h3>
<p>Geth is the program we will be using to connect to the blockchain. It is already taken care of in the VirtualBox image, and you can skip to step 2 if you are using the VB image.</p>
<p>You will need to <a href="https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/install-and-build/installing-geth">install geth</a>. The instructions differ depending on your OS.</p>
<p>Geth, which stands for Go Ethereum, is a command-line interface to run an Ethereum node. This particular implementation is written in the Go programming language.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> DO NOT JUST RUN <code>geth</code>! Doing so will connect to the default Ethereum network, and will proceed to download the ENTIRE Ethereum blockchain, which is around 500 Gb for a “light” node and over 1 Tb for a “full” node. It also takes a full week (at least) to synchronize all that data.</p>
<h3 id="part-2-blockchain-connection">Part 2: Blockchain Connection</h3>
<p>Here we will connect to the private blockchain.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a directory to hold the blockchain info – this can be anywhere you want, but we’ll call it <code>/path/to/ethprivate</code> herein.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In that data directory, copy the course genesis.json file, which can be found in the Collab Resources section, and is linked to off of the Collab landing page. You cannot modify this file – if you do, the genesis block will be different, which will cause the hash to be different, and then your local geth instance will not sync with the course blockchain.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Initialize geth with the following command, but change the path (twice) in that command before you run it:</p>
<pre><code>geth --datadir /path/to/ethprivate/ init /path/to/ethprivate/genesis.json</code></pre>
<p>If you are in the geth data directory, and the genesis.json file is in that directory, you can run the command as follows:</p>
<pre><code>geth --datadir . init genesis.json</code></pre>
<p>You should see about a dozen lines of output, and the last one should be something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>INFO [07-26|09:11:07.145] Successfully wrote genesis state          database=lightchaindata          hash=XXXXXX..XXXXXX</code></pre>
<p>There are two things to check to ensure that this worked correctly:</p>
<ul>
<li>It should say “Successfully wrote genesis state”</li>
<li>The genesis block hash, shown above as <code>XXXXXX..XXXXXX</code>, should exactly match what is listed on the Collab landing page</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Create a <code>geth/static-nodes.json</code> file in your data directory. The <code>geth/</code> sub-directory will have been created by the previous step. This file lists a static node so you can connect to our blockchain – one of the departmental servers will be used for this purpose. That file is also on the Collab landing page. Make sure it goes into the <code>geth/</code> sub-directory!</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Start geth. Run the following command, changing three things: (1) the userid to your own, (2) the data directory to what you used above, and (3) the networkid value to the <code>chainId</code> to the value on the Collab landing page.</p>
<pre><code>geth --identity &quot;mst3k&quot; --datadir /path/to/ethprivate --networkid 12345678 --maxpeers 1 --nodiscover --syncmode full --gcmode &quot;archive&quot;</code></pre>
<p>It’s a long command, and we’ll be adding flags as the semester continues. We recommend you put that command into a script or batch file so you don’t have to re-type it each time.</p>
<p>There is minimal output when it is running, and we will verify that it has connected properly in a moment.</p>
<h3 id="part-3-explore-geth">Part 3: Explore geth</h3>
<p>What is running from part 2 is the Ethereum node, but that is not interactive. You should leave it running while you perform the next few parts of this assignment.</p>
<p>To enter commands via the keyboard, you have to “attach” to the local Ethereum node. You do this by entering the following command:</p>
<pre><code>geth attach /path/to/ethprivate/geth.ipc</code></pre>
<p>If you are in the same directory as geth.ipc, you may have to enter <code>./geth.ipc</code> as the file name. Note that this won’t work unless the geth node, from the previous step, is running. You will then get a prompt, which is just a greater-than sign. This is a JavaScript console.</p>
<p>If you have this installed on Windows, when you start the geth node, you will see output like <a href="geth-on-windows.png">this</a> – the text circled in red is the file name for the geth.ipc file (putting <code>geth attach</code> before it). It will likely be either of the following:</p>
<pre><code>geth attach \\.\pipe\geth.ipc
geth attach ipc:\\\\.\\pipe\\geth.ipc</code></pre>
<p>That second line rendered correctly – it has three sets of backslahses – 4, then 2, then 2. And run it from the directory that your geth.ipc file is in. As before, note that this won’t work unless the geth node, from the previous step, is running.</p>
<p>In either case, you will then get a prompt, which is just a greater-than sign. This is a JavaScript console.</p>
<p>First, let’s wait for it to sync. Since you have saved the static-nodes.json file, it will connect to the course server and start downloading all the blocks in the blockchain. This may take some time, but hopefully less than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>As it is sync’ing, you can try these commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>admin.peers.length</code> will tell you how many peers you are connected to – it should be at least 1. Because you ran it with the <code>--maxpeers 1</code>, it probably won’t be greater than 1. If you enter this right after you start up geth, it may return 0, as it is still connecting to the peer(s).</li>
<li><code>admin.peers</code> will print information on each of those peers. Once established, it should list exactly one peer – the course server, whose ‘enode’ specification is the same as the static-nodes.json file that you downloaded.</li>
<li><code>eth.blockNumber</code> will return the highest block number in the blockchain that is on your computer. If it is returning zero, then it is not sync’ed (or is not trying to sync).</li>
<li><code>eth.syncing</code> will either return ‘false’ if it is not syncing, or a JSON dictionary if it is.
<ul>
<li>If <code>eth.blockNumber</code> is 0 and <code>eth.syncing</code> is false, then it is not sync’ing, perhaps due to a networking connection issue. This will always be the case right after geth starts and before it has had a chance to connect to peers.</li>
<li>If <code>eth.syncing</code> is false and <code>eth.blockNumber</code> is non-zero, then, most likely, it has completed syncing (it could also be that geth just started, and it hasn’t had a chance to start sync’ing yet).</li>
<li>If <code>eth.syncing</code> returns a JSON dictionary, then it is in the process of sync’ing.
<ul>
<li>The <code>currentBlock</code> value, aka <code>eth.syncing.currentBlock</code> is the highest block it has sync’ed so far; this is also the value that <code>eth.blockNumber</code> returns</li>
<li>The <code>highestBlock</code> value, aka <code>eth.syncing.highestBlock</code>, is what it is working on sync’ing up to</li>
<li>Once <code>currentBlock</code> reaches <code>highestBlock</code>, then the sync’ing will be complete</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can use this command to print out the syncing status: <code>console.log ("at " + eth.blockNumber + " of " + eth.syncing.highestBlock + " blocks; " + (eth.syncing.highestBlock-eth.blockNumber) + " blocks left to sync")</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Once it is sync’ed, here are some commands for you to try out:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>personal.newAccount()</code> will generate an Ethereum account for you. If you were to do this on the Ethereum Mainnet, you would most definitely have to enter a password. You probably don’t need to have one for this key, since the ether on this blockchain has no monetary value. It will give you an account address back, such as 0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567. Let’s only create one account for now!</li>
<li>You can get that account number anytime via <code>eth.coinbase</code></li>
<li>You can check the balance in your account by <code>eth.getBalance("0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567")</code> – it should be zero at this point
<ul>
<li>Or try: <code>eth.getBalance(eth.coinbase)</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="part-4-get-ether">Part 4: Get ether</h3>
<p>You cannot mine on this blockchain – it has been set up to automatically mine any transaction to the blockchain for you. In order to obtain some funds, you should go to the course Ethereum Faucet, the URL of which is listed on the Collab landing page. Each time you use this faucet you will obtain 10 (fake) ETH. <strong>USE THIS RESPONSIBLY!!!</strong> The intent of the faucet is for you to obtain as much funds as you need. But if you spam that site with unnecessary requests to gain lots of funds, it will deplete the amount avaialbe for the course, interfering with your classmates ability to do their work. This will make me cranky. If you request funds a few dozen times throughout the semester, that’s totally fine. Even a hundred requests this semester would be fine. But if you are making the requests thousands of times, that’s going to be a problem.</p>
<p>You should request funds once or twice. After you make the requests – you’ll need your full eth.coinbase account address – you should check that your balance was updated in the geth terminal. You can use <code>eth.getBalance(eth.coinbase)</code>, but that reports it in wei (which has 18 more zeroes). You can also use <code>web3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(eth.coinbase), "ether")</code> to get the value in ether.</p>
<p>To verify that you did this part, we are going to check that you have a non-zero balance in your eth.coinbase account.</p>
<h3 id="part-5-extract-key">Part 5: Extract key</h3>
<p>We need to get the private key of the account you created, as we will need that for our dApp development in future assignments. The private key is encrypted in a .json file in the keystore/ sub-directory of your geth data directory. The file will have a name like: UTC–2022-01-08T19-53-08.823103866Z–0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567. Note that the last part of that name (“0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567”) matches the Ethereum address we obtained and that is returned from <code>eth.coinbase</code>.</p>
<p>First, ensure that the <code>web3</code> and <code>hexbytes</code> Python packages are installed – run <code>pip install web3 hexbytes</code> or <code>pip3 install web3 hexbytes</code>.</p>
<p>Run python (or python3, depending on your OS). Note that we are going back to Python, and will come back to geth later. In Python, enter the following two lines, changing the values as appropriate to the file name (with full path) and the password for the Ethereum account you created in geth:</p>
<pre><code>password=&quot;password&quot;
filename=&quot;/path/to/ethprivate/keystore/UTC--2022-01-08T19-53-08.823103866Z--0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Next, cut-and-paste the following code into your Python terminal.:</p>
<pre><code>from web3.auto import w3
keyfile = open(filename)
encrypted_key = keyfile.read()
private_key = w3.eth.account.decrypt(encrypted_key,password)
import binascii
binascii.b2a_hex(private_key)</code></pre>
<p>When you run it, it will look like the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ python3
Python 3.8.10 (default, Nov 26 2021, 20:14:08) 
[GCC 9.3.0] on linux
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; password=&#39;password&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; filename=&#39;/path/to/ethprivate/keystore/UTC--2022-01-08T19-53-08.823103866Z--0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; from web3.auto import w3
&gt;&gt;&gt; keyfile = open(filename)
&gt;&gt;&gt; encrypted_key = keyfile.read()
&gt;&gt;&gt; private_key = w3.eth.account.decrypt(encrypted_key,password)
&gt;&gt;&gt; import binascii
&gt;&gt;&gt; binascii.b2a_hex(private_key)
b&#39;0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
$</code></pre>
<p>The decoded private key is the hex line at the end – you should remove the leading <code>b'</code> and trailing <code>'</code>.</p>
<p>Save this decoded private key somewhere, as you will need it in future assignments. Normally we would never save this in plaintext, but the (fake) ETH on this system are still worth $0.</p>
<h3 id="part-6-send-me-ether">Part 6: Send me ether</h3>
<p>Next you are going to send me some money via the geth command line. We are done with Python for this assignment, and have to go back to the geth prompt (via <code>geth attach /path/to/ethprivate/geth.ipc</code>) for this.</p>
<p>To send (fake) ETH, you have to first unlock your account:</p>
<pre><code>personal.unlockAccount(&quot;0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567&quot;);</code></pre>
<p>This will prompt you for your password. You have to replace the address shown with your account address (via <code>eth.accounts</code>. You can also use <code>eth.coinbase</code> as the account address, as that should be the same account. By default it unlocks for 5 minutes; you can unlock it until geth exits via: <code>personal.unlockAccount(eth.coinbase, "password", 0)</code> (replacing <code>password</code> with your account’s password).</p>
<p>You can then send me 1 (fake) ETH:</p>
<pre><code>eth.sendTransaction({from:eth.coinbase, to:&#39;0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff&#39;, value:web3.toWei(1,&quot;ether&quot;), gas:21000});</code></pre>
<p>You have to replace the ‘to’ field with the address found on the Collab landing page. Note that we replaced your account address with <code>eth.coinbase</code>. This will print out a hex string – save it! That’s the hash of the transaction, and we’ll need it shortly. It will be something long like: 0xabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcd.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Be sure you cut-and-paste the course account properly! It’s easy to mis-type the account, and send the ether to the wrong place (where it can never be accessed again).</p>
<p>Further steps to do in the geth console:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check your balance via <code>eth.getBalance("0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567")</code> – you may notice that the balanace has not changed if you enter that before the transaction was not mined into a block.
<ul>
<li>You can also get your account balance in (fake) ETH via: <code>web3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(eth.coinbase), "ether")</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can see your pending transaction via <code>eth.pendingTransactions</code> (again, only if you enter that before it is mined into a block).</li>
<li>Get information on the mined transaction: <code>eth.getTransactionReceipt("0xabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcd")</code> – replace the hash there with the transaction hash you recorded, above.
<ul>
<li>Note the block number, which you will have to submit along with the transaction hash</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We can verify that you did this part by checking if your eth.coinbase account sent 1 ETH to the intended course account.</p>
<h3 id="part-7-explore-geth-more">Part 7: Explore geth more</h3>
<p>You should explore geth on your own. When you start geth (via <code>geth attach geth.ipc</code>), it lists the modules available:</p>
<pre><code>Welcome to the Geth JavaScript console!

instance: Geth/v1.10.15-stable-8be800ff/linux-amd64/go1.17.5
coinbase: 0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
at block: 52 (Sat Jan 08 2022 21:49:04 GMT-0500 (EST))
 datadir: /home/crypto/ethprivate
 modules: admin:1.0 clique:1.0 debug:1.0 eth:1.0 miner:1.0 net:1.0 personal:1.0 rpc:1.0 txpool:1.0 web3:1.0

To exit, press ctrl-d or type exit
&gt; </code></pre>
<p>Your geth version number may be more recent. The modules are listed on the 7th line (admin, clique, debug, eth, miner, net, personal, rpc, txpool, and web3). In the console, type the start of the module, a period, and hit the Tab key – it will show you all the possible completions. If you type in the name and it’s a function, it will tell you that. And if you try to run the function with no parameters, and it needs parameters, it will tell you that as well. Lastly, it’s a JavaScript console, so you can use any JavaScript programming, if you happen to know JavaScript. (You won’t need to know much JavaScript for this course).</p>
<h3 id="part-8-blockchain-explorer">Part 8: Blockchain Explorer</h3>
<p>We have a web-based blockchain explorer for our private Ethereum blockchain. The link to that is on the Collab landing page. Browse that site, and play around with the search functionality. Directions for how to use it are on the main page. Note that the site updates every 5 minutes, so if you make a transaction, it will not be immediately visible there – the time of the last update is listed on the main page (the bottom bullet under ‘Statistics’).</p>
<p>Find the web page that contains the transaction (not the block!) where you send me the 1 (fake) ETH; you will need to submit this URL.</p>
<h3 id="closing-down">Closing down</h3>
<p>If you are not actively using it, you should shut your geth node down. UVA ITS has given permission to do all this, but they do perform port scans on all machines, so no need to raise their hackles by keeping a geth node up and running when we aren’t using it. You can easily re-launch it when you need it again for a future assignment. Likewise for the console from part (3); if you close down the geth node, the console won’t work.</p>
<h3 id="submission">Submission</h3>
<p>You will need to fill in the various values from this assignment into the <a href="ethprivate.py.html">ethprivate.py</a> (<a href="ethprivate.py">src</a>) file. That file clearly indicates all the values that need to be filled in. That file is the only file that must be submitted for this assignment; future assignments will have additional Solidity source code submitted as well. The ‘sanity_checks’ dictionary is intended to be a checklist to ensure that you perform the various other aspects to ensure this assignment is fully submitted.</p>
<p>There are <em>two</em> forms of submission for this assignment; you must do both.</p>
<p>Submission 1: You must send 1 (fake) ETH to the course-wide address indicated on the Collab landing page; this was done in part 6, above.</p>
<p>Submission 2: You should submit your completed <code>ethprivate.py</code> file, and ONLY that file, to Gradescope.</p>
