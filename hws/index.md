Cryptocurrency: Homeworks
=========================

[Go up to the main CCC readme](../readme.html) ([md](../readme.md))

You will be bound by the requirements on the [Homeworks policies page](../uva/hw-policies.html) ([md](../uva/hw-policies.md)), so please read that!  The due dates are all listed on the [main UVa page](../uva/index.html) ([md](../uva/index.md)).


### Programing homeworks

These are larger programming homeworks.

- [P1: Introductory homework](intro/index.html) ([md](intro/index.md))
- [P2: ECDSA implementation](ecdsa/index.html) ([md](ecdsa/index.md))
- [P3: BTC parser](btcparser/index.html) ([md](btcparser/index.md))
- P4: Bitcoin scripting



### Smaller homeworks

These are smaller homeworks that take less time.  They are often readings or self-guided tutorials.

- S1: Google course introductory survey: the link for the survey is in the [Collab workspace](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/directtool/7c8e4ae8-4bb5-4d1f-9fd6-9d9323721551/)
- S2: Read the [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/)
- HW S3: read (some of) the [Ethereum whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/) ([PDF](https://blockchainlab.com/pdf/Ethereum_white_paper-a_next_generation_smart_contract_and_decentralized_application_platform-vitalik-buterin.pdf))
    - You can skip (or quickly browse) the first 3 sub-parts of the 'History' section ('Bitcoin', 'Mining', and 'Merkle Trees'); also skip the 'references and further reading' section at the end; what's left is 24 pages in the PDF to read
