<h1 id="gradebook-smart-contract">Gradebook Smart Contract</h1>
<p><a href="../index.html">Go up to the CCC HW page</a> (<a
href="../index.md">md</a>)</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>I need a new gradebook! Because Collab and my favorite spreadsheet
programs are just not doing the job anymore. So I’ve decided to keep
everybody’s grades in a public blockchain. Your task is to implement
this gradebook for me.</p>
<p>Note: I’m not going to to keep <em>real</em> grades in the gradebook.
In addition to the fact that doing so would violate your privacy, it
would also be a violation of <a
href="https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">FERPA</a>.
So only fake grades will be kept herein.</p>
<p>Admittedly, a gradebook of private grades being kept on a public
blockchain is not the most realistic use of smart contracts. But it will
introduce you to the concepts involved in developing smart contracts.
And there are many very similar applications that would only require a
few tweaks to the gradebook contract. There are organizations that
coordinate through blockchains, and they have to keep some information
on members; while not grades, it involves the same concepts.</p>
<h3 id="changelog">Changelog</h3>
<p>Any changes to this page will be put here for easy reference. Typo
fixes and minor clarifications are not listed here. So far there aren’t
any significant changes to report.</p>
<h3 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Writing this homework will require completion of the following
assignments:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../ethprivate/index.html">Connecting to the private
Ethereum blockchain</a> (<a href="../ethprivate/index.md">md</a>)</li>
<li><a href="../dappintro/index.html">dApp introduction</a> (<a
href="../dappintro/index.md">md</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also need to be familiar with the <a
href="../../slides/ethereum.html#/">Ethereum slide set</a>, and the <a
href="../../slides/solidity.html#/">Solidity slide set</a>.</p>
<h3 id="part-1-write-the-gradebook-smart-contract">Part 1: Write the
Gradebook smart contract</h3>
<h4 id="overview-1">Overview</h4>
<p>The gradebook will need to have the following functionalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assignments can be created; each assignment has a maximum score</li>
<li>Grades for students can be entered and updated for a given
assignment</li>
<li>Anybody can look up any student’s grades (again, these are only
<em>fake</em> grades)</li>
<li>The instructor can designate others as teaching assistants</li>
<li>Only instructors and teaching assistants can create assignments and
enter/update grades</li>
<li>Anybody can get a student’s average score</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="interface">Interface</h4>
<p>Formally, your contract will need to be named <code>Gradebook</code>,
and saved in a file named <code>Gradebook.sol</code>. It will need to
implement the <a href="IGradebook.sol.html">IGradebook.sol</a> (<a
href="IGradebook.sol">src</a>) interface, which is as follows.
<strong>NOTE:</strong> the interface file itself has many more details
in the comments; most of the comments were stripped for what is
below.</p>
<pre><code>// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

// See the actual IGradebook.sol file, linked to above, for much more detailed comments

interface IGradebook {

    event assignmentCreationEvent (uint indexed _id);

    event gradeEntryEvent (uint indexed _id);

    // The following six methods are done for you automatically -- as long as
    // you make the appropriate variable public, then Solidity will create
    // the getter function for you
    
    function tas(address ta) external returns (bool);

    function max_scores(uint id) external returns (uint);

    function assignment_names(uint id) external returns (string memory);

    function scores(uint id, string memory userid) external returns (uint);

    function num_assignments() external returns (uint);

    function instructor() external returns (address);

    // The following four functions are ones you must implement

    function designateTA(address ta) external;

    function addAssignment(string memory name, uint max_score) external returns (uint);

    function addGrade(string memory student, uint assignment, uint score) external;

    function getAverage(string memory student) external view returns (uint);

    // The implementation for the following is provided in the HW description

    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) external view returns (bool);

}</code></pre>
<h4 id="implementation-details">Implementation details</h4>
<ul>
<li>Students are all identified by a single string; we’ll use UVA
userids</li>
<li>All entered grades are (unsigned) integers</li>
<li>One cannot have a grade higher than the max score; this should be
checked via a <code>require()</code></li>
<li>While averages can be non-integers, we will return the (truncated)
integer value that is 100 times the average. So if somebody’s average
was 86.265%, the returned average would be 8626.</li>
<li>The only task the constructor needs to do is set the
<code>instructor</code> field to <code>msg.sender</code></li>
<li>Your contract opening line MUST be: <code>contract Gradebook is
IGradebook {</code></li>
<li>All of your methods and fields will have to have the
<code>override</code> qualifier, since they are overriding what is
specified in the <code>IGradebook</code> interface</li>
</ul>
<p>The first six methods (after the two events) are getter functions. As
long as you set the visibility of the field in the contract as
<code>public</code>, then the getter method is created for you, as <a
href="../../slides/solidity.html#/getters">discussed in the lecture
slides</a>. For example, for the getter function <code>function
num_assignments() external returns (uint)</code>, the appropriate field
declaration would be <code>uint public override num_assignments;</code>.
The lecture slide details this a bit more.</p>
<p>The two events, listed at the top of the interface, should be emitted
at the appropriate time. The <code>addAssignment()</code> function
should emit <code>assignmentCreationEvent()</code> event, and the
<code>addGrade()</code> function should emit the
<code>gradeEntryEvent()</code> event. Be sure to emit the events
<em>after</em> any <code>require()</code> calls!</p>
<h4 id="supportsinterface"><code>supportsInterface()</code></h4>
<p>We will see the use of <code>supportsInterface()</code> in a lecture
and a later assignment. For now, you should use this exact
implementation:</p>
<pre><code>function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) external pure returns (bool) {
        return interfaceId == type(IGradebook).interfaceId || interfaceId == 0x01ffc9a7;
}</code></pre>
<h4 id="testing">Testing</h4>
<p>You will invariably run into issues testing and debugging your code.
We have a few tips and tricks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>require()</code>. A lot. And be sure to use the <a
href="../../slides/solidity.html#/require">two-parameter version of
<code>require()</code></a>.</li>
<li>Keep in mind the <a
href="../../slides/solidity.html#/debugging">Solidity testing &amp;
debugging ideas</a> from the lecture slides</li>
<li>Once you have tested it in the Javascript deployment environment,
you will want to interact with our private blockchain, as described in
the <a href="../dappintro/index.html">dApp introduction</a> assignment.
Remember that, in Remix, when you initiate a transaction (orange button)
– rather than a call (blue button) – you will have to mine it into the
blockchain. Via a <code>geth attach</code> terminal, run
<code>miner.start()</code> and then <code>miner.stop()</code>.</li>
<li>In Remix you are going to end up calling a bunch of functions to
initialize your smart contract for testing – for example, to create a
few assignments, add some scores, etc. Once you know those functions
work properly, you can put them in the constructor, as such. This will
save you time, but <strong>BE SURE</strong> to remove those lines once
you are finished testing it and prior to submission.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>designateTA(0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567);
addAssignment(&quot;HW1&quot;,10);
addAssignment(&quot;HW2&quot;,10);
addGrade(&quot;mst3k&quot;,0,5);
addGrade(&quot;mst3k&quot;,1,10);</code></pre>
<h4 id="deployment">Deployment</h4>
<p>Once done, you will need to deploy your CoruseGradebook smart
contract to our private Ethereum blockchain. Save the contract address,
as you will need to submit that, below. It’s okay if you deploy it
multiple times (for testing, debugging, errors, etc.). Just submit the
address of the last one you deployed.</p>
<p>You need to designate me as a TA for your gradebook. The address to
designate is on the Collab landing page. Other than that one call to
<code>designateTA()</code>, you should not make any other calls to the
deployed smart contract. If you make other calls, please re-deploy it,
re-call <code>designateTA()</code>, and submit that deployed contract
address.</p>
<h3 id="part-2-what-is-your-average">Part 2: What is your average?</h3>
<p>I’ve deployed a gradebook with your (fake) grades. The address for
that smart contract is on the Collab landing page. You will need to find
out your overall average as well as a few other items of information.
Your scores are kept by your UVA userid. These scores are fake, and were
randomly generated, so don’t feel bad if your score(s) are low.</p>
<p>There are two ways you can access the gradebook on the blockchain.
One is through Remix, like was done in the <a
href="../dappintro/index.html">dApp introduction assignment</a> (<a
href="../dappintro/index.md">md</a>) – you load the IGradebook.sol
interface, and then enter the address of the deployed Gradebook contract
into the ‘At Address’ text box in the deployment window. The other way
is through geth, like we did in the <a
href="../../slides/solidity.html#/debtor">live coding example in
class</a> – the geth commands start about 8 slides down in that column.
For this you will also need the ABI. You can compile the IGradebook.sol
interface, and then copy the ABI – after you compile it, the copy ABI
link is at the very bottom of the compilation pane. Note that you may
have to reformat that ABI a bit – what you copy is on many lines, and
you may have to reformat it to one line.</p>
<p>The information you need to obtain is:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your (fake) average? Recall that it reports an integer that
is 100 times your average (so 1234 means your average is 12.34%)</li>
<li>What are the maximum number of points on the assignment with index
3?</li>
<li>What is YOUR score on the assignment with index 3?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="submission">Submission</h3>
<p>You will need to fill in the various values from this assignment into
the <a href="gradebook.py.html">gradebook.py</a> (<a
href="gradebook.py">src</a>) file. That file clearly indicates all the
values that need to be filled in. That file, along with your Solidity
source code, are the only files that must be submitted. The
‘sanity_checks’ dictionary is intended to be a checklist to ensure that
you perform the various other aspects to ensure this assignment is fully
submitted.</p>
<p>There are <em>two</em> forms of submission for this assignment; you
must do both.</p>
<p>Submission 1: You must deploy your smart contract to our private
Ethereum blockchain – this was probably done above. It’s fine if you
deploy it a few times because you were testing it, screwed something up,
or whatever. But the final deployment should not have any data other
than the one call to <code>designateTA()</code>.</p>
<p>Submission 2: You should submit your <code>Gradebook.sol</code> file,
as well as your <code>gradebook.py</code> file, and ONLY those two
files, to Gradescope. All your Solidity code should be in that first
file, and you should specifically import the various interfaces. Those
interface files will be placed in the same directory on Gradescope when
you submit. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Gradescope cannot fully test this
assignment, as it does not have access to the private blockchain. So it
can only do a few sanity tests (correct files submitted, successful
compilation, valid values in auction.py, etc.).</p>
