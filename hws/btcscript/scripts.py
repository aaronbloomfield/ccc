# - txout: the transaction output of the transaction being signed; type: CMutableTxOut
# - txin_scriptPubKey: the pubKey script of the transaction being signed; type: list

# transaction hash, above, that funded your account with tBTC.  You may have
# to split multiple UTXOs, so if you are splitting a different faucet
# transaction, then change this appropriately. It must have been paid to the
# address that corresponds to the private key above
txid_split = txid_funding_list[0]

# After all the splits, you should have around 10 (or more) UTXOs, all for the
# amount specified in this variable. That amount should not be less than
# 0.0001 BTC, and can be greater.  It will make your life easier if each
# amount is a negative power of 10, but that's not required.

# to 90% of the value of the UTXO index is reasonable.  Note that the amount
