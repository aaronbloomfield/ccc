<h1 id="ethereum-tokens">Ethereum Tokens</h1>
<p><a href="../index.html">Go up to the CCC HW page</a> (<a
href="../index.md">md</a>)</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>In this assignment you are going to develop and deploy two types of
tokens on our private Ethereum blockchain. You will develop a
cryptocurrency using the <a
href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/">ERC-20
token standard</a>, and you will deploy an NFT (non-fungible token)
manager using the <a
href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/">ERC-721
token standard</a>.</p>
<p>The actual amount of code developed in this assignment is relatively
small. The complexity is understanding the code of the existing
implementations and extending them.</p>
<p>As you develop the items in this assignment, keep in mind that – on
our private Ethereum blockchain – it is possible to track back whose
smart contracts are whose.</p>
<h3 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>You will have to have completed the <a
href="../ethprivate/index.html">connecting to the private Ethereum
blockchain</a> assignment as well as the <a
href="../dappintro/index.html">dApp Introduction</a> assignment. You
will also need to be familiar with the <a
href="../../slides/tokens.html#/">lecture slides on Tokens</a>. For some
of the tasks below you will need to launch your geth node, connecting to
the course server, and start up a geth Javascript terminal; how to do
all that is all described in the <a
href="../ethprivate/index.html">connecting to the private Ethereum
blockchain</a> assignment. You will also need to launch a geth terminal,
which is also described in the that assignment.</p>
<p>If you have not successfully completed those two assignments, then
you will not be able to complete this assignment.</p>
<h3 id="part-1-erc-20-fungible-token">Part 1: ERC-20 Fungible Token</h3>
<p>In this part, you will create a fungible token that follows the
(enhanced) <a
href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/">ERC-20
token standard</a>. This token will represent a token cryptocurrency.
You will use this code in a future assignment, where you will then be
creating a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange for the cryptocurrency
that you are creating here.</p>
<h4 id="part-1-task-1-name-your-cryptocurrency">Part 1, task 1: Name
your cryptocurrency</h4>
<p>You can pick any name that you want. Keep in mind that it is possible
for the other students to figure out who deployed what cryptocurrency by
analyzing the blockchain. You can not use the name of the course
cryptocurrency or of an <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">existing
cryptocurrency</a>. Feel free to be funny and creative here, but please
be appropriate in your selection.</p>
<p>You will need to create both a name and an abbreviation. Your name
and abbreviation cannot already exist. To see if an abbreviation exists,
see if there is a file with that abbreviation in the
<code>cclogos/</code> directory in Collab’s resources – if so, then some
other student has claimed that abbreviation. To claim one, put a file
named <code>xyz.png</code> (where <code>xyz</code> is your
cryptocurrency abbreviation) there. You can put a placeholder file there
while you work on the logo (below). Please make the file name be all
lower case.</p>
<p>Following in the precedent for currently existing cryptocurrencies,
abbreviations are at most four characters, but typically three, and
possibly two. You can have letters and numbers, but not symbols; the
first character of the abbreviation must be a letter. The abbreviation
when representing the cryptocurrency is always rendered in upper case,
but the logo file is all lower case with a “.png” extension.</p>
<h4 id="part-1-task-2-create-a-logo">Part 1, task 2: Create a logo</h4>
<p>You will need to create a logo for your cryptocurrency. The logo that
you submit should be 128x128 pixels in size. Use a fun color! Create a
neat logo! But please make sure the logo is appropriate. You can look at
the types of logos on a site such as <a
href="https://www.gate.io/en/marketlist?tab=usdt">gate.io</a> for
ideas.</p>
<p>The logo itself should be a circular logo with a transparent
background outside the circle (just like what is on gate.io). Note that
your logo must be readable if the size were reduced to a 32x32 pixel
version. The submission must be a .png file, and it will have to be
named <code>logo.png</code>. You can use a free program such as <a
href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> to edit your program. You can use
this <a href="logo-template.png">logo-template.png</a> file as a starter
file – it is the correct size and has a transparent background.</p>
<h4 id="part-1-task-3-review-the-starter-code">Part 1, task 3: Review
the starter code</h4>
<p>The code we are going to start with is the <a
href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.0.0/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol">OpenZeppelin
ERC-20 implementation</a>. This code was the same as was discussed in
class. Other than the <code>import</code> lines, there have been no
changes to the code in this repo.</p>
<p>The included code is:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Context.sol.html">Context.sol</a> (<a
href="Context.sol">src</a>) is a better way to get the context rather
than <code>msg.sender</code> and <code>msg.data</code></li>
<li><a href="IERC165.sol.html">IERC165.sol</a> (<a
href="IERC165.sol">src</a>), as <a
href="../../tokens.html#/erc165">discussed in lecture</a></li>
<li><a href="IERC20.sol.html">IERC20.sol</a> (<a
href="IERC20.sol">src</a>), as <a
href="../../tokens.html#/erc20">discussed in lecture</a></li>
<li><a href="IERC20Metadata.sol.html">IERC20Metadata.sol</a> (<a
href="IERC20Metadata.sol">src</a>), as <a
href="../../tokens.html#/erc20">discussed in lecture</a></li>
<li><a href="ERC20.sol.html">ERC20.sol</a> (<a
href="ERC20.sol">src</a>), which is the <a
href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.0.0/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol">OpenZeppelin
ERC-20 implementation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There were a few changes made to the <a
href="ERC20.sol.html">ERC20.sol</a> (<a href="ERC20.sol">src</a>) file
from the <a
href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.0.0/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol">OpenZeppelin
implementation</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>import</code> lines were modified so that they include
everything from this directory</li>
<li>The <code>ERC20</code> contract now inherits from
<code>IERC20Metadata</code> rather than <code>IERC20</code>, as we want
to ensure it has the <code>name()</code>, <code>symbol()</code>, and
<code>decimals()</code> methods in the <a
href="IERC20Metadata.sol.html">IERC20Metadata.sol</a> (<a
href="IERC20Metadata.sol">src</a>) file</li>
<li>As those three methods (<code>name()</code>, <code>symbol()</code>,
and <code>decimals()</code>) are now overriding from the
<code>IERC20Metadata</code> contract, the <code>override</code>
qualifier was added</li>
<li>The <code>decimals()</code> visibility was lowered to
<code>external</code> to allow us to easily override it</li>
</ul>
<p>You should look over and familiarize yourself with all this code. The
inheritance hierarchy of this code is shown below.</p>
<p><img src="inheritance.dot.1.svg" /></p>
<h4 id="part-1-task-4-develop-the-smart-contract">Part 1, task 4:
Develop the smart contract</h4>
<p>You will need to develop the smart contract for your cryptocurrency,
and deploy it to our private Ethereum blockchain. Your code will use the
five files listed above. These files all come from <a
href="https://openzeppelin.com/">OpenZeppelin</a>, specifically the <a
href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts">OpenZeppelin
github repo</a>.</p>
<p>There are some very strict submission requirements for this
submission so that we can grade it in a sane manner:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Your contract MUST be in a file called <code>TokenCC.sol</code></li>
<li>You must put your name and userid as the second line of the file
(right after the SPDX line)</li>
<li>Your contract opening line MUST be: <code>contract TokenCC is ERC20,
IERC165 {</code>; this will inherit the other contracts (Context, IERC20
and IERC20Metadata)</li>
<li>The pragma line should be: <code>pragma solidity ^0.8.7;</code></li>
<li>You are NOT to submit any of the <em>files</em> for the interfaces
above (Context.sol, IERC20.sol, IERC20Metadata.sol, or IERC165.sol), nor
the ERC20.sol file. And don’t include the code from those files in your
TokenCC.sol file. You should <code>import</code> them in
<code>TokenCC.sol</code> as such: <code>import "./IERC165.sol";</code>
and <code>import "./ERC20.sol";</code> – those two files import all the
other contracts. The necessary files will be put into the appropriate
directory on Gradescope when it attempts to compile your program.</li>
<li>You cannot submit any files other than the <code>TokenCC.sol</code>
file; all your code must be in that <code>TokenCC.sol</code> file</li>
<li>You cannot edit the <a href="ERC20.sol.html">ERC20.sol</a> (<a
href="ERC20.sol">src</a>) file – any changes have to go into your
<code>TokenCC.sol</code> file</li>
</ol>
<p>Your task is to create a <code>TokenCC.sol</code> file with a
<code>TokenCC</code> contract. Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have to define the name and symbol when the constructor is
called – you can do this by calling the base class (<code>ERC20</code>)
constructor that takes two parameters – to see how to do this, look at
<a href="../../slides/tokens.html#/erc20constructor">this lecture
slide</a> and the <a
href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/contracts.html#arguments-for-base-constructors">Arguments
for Base Constructors</a> section of the Solidity language
reference.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that, because the <code>_mint()</code> function is
<code>internal</code>, it can only be called from code you write. So
your constructor should mint for you a reasonable amount of the
cryptocurrency.<br />
</li>
<li>To override the <code>decimals()</code> function, you can just
create an appropriate variable. Be sure to make those three fields
<code>public</code> and <code>override</code>!</li>
<li>You have to implement the <code>supportsInterface()</code> method to
fulfill the requirements of the <a
href="IERC165.sol.html">IERC165.sol</a> (<a href="IERC165.sol">src</a>)
contract; remember that your code supports <em>three</em> interfaces:
<code>IERC165</code>, <code>IERC20</code>, and
<code>IERC20Metadata</code>
<ul>
<li>It also extends <code>Context</code>, but there are no
<code>external</code> or <code>public</code> methods in
<code>Context</code>, so there is no interface there to support.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Minting considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many decimals you pick is up to you. Ethereum uses 18; Bitcoin
uses 8. To make this a bit more sane for us to manage, let’s choose a
number between 8 and 12 (inclusive).</li>
<li>How many coins you mint is up to you. We would recommend no less
than 100 coins. On the other end of the spectrum, <a
href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/">SHIB</a> – a
token cryptocurrency on Ethereum – minted 549,063,278,876,302 (yes,
<span class="math inline">5.5 * 10<sup>14</sup></span>) coins.
<ul>
<li>Keep in mind the amount you are specifying in the mint call is <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> * 10<sup><em>d</em></sup></span> where
<span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is how many coins you want
to mint and <span class="math inline"><em>d</em></span> is the number of
decimal places.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to thoroughly test this in Remix! Remember that you have
multiple accounts in the Javascript deployment environment, so you can
transfer your new cryptocurrency back and forth. Just switch the account
in the “Account” drop-down list to initiate a transaction from a
different account.</p>
<h4 id="part-1-task-5-deployment">Part 1, task 5: Deployment</h4>
<p>One you have thoroughly tested your ERC-20 token in Remix, you should
deploy it to our private Ethereum blockchain. How to do this was covered
in the <a href="../dappintro/index.html">dApp Introduction</a>
assignment, which you may want to refer back to. You have to deploy this
part and the next part from the same account, and you will have to
submit that account address at the end.</p>
<p>Save the contract address it was deployed to, as well as the
transaction hash from that transaction, as you will need to submit those
at the end of this assignment.</p>
<h4 id="part-1-task-6-send-me-some-money">Part 1, task 6: Send me some
money!</h4>
<p>You need to transfer some amount of your cryptocurrency. The address
to transfer it to in on the Collab landing page. This should be through
the <code>transfer()</code> function (NOT <code>approve()</code>). It
doesn’t matter how much you transfer, but at least 1.0 coin(s), and not
<em>all</em> of your coins. Save the transaction hash of when you sent
me your cryptocurrency, as well as the amount.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="part-2-erc-721-non-fungible-token">Part 2: ERC-721 Non-Fungible
Token</h3>
<p>In this part, you will create a non-fungible token that follows the
<a
href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/">ERC-721
token standard</a>. This token can represent anything, but we will have
it represent some image. You will use this code in a future assignment,
where you will then be creating a decentralized auction for NFTs.</p>
<h4 id="part-2-task-1-nft-image">Part 2, task 1: NFT image</h4>
<p>You will be creating two images for NFTs for this assignment. The
images should be uploaded to the <code>ipfs/</code> directory in the
Collab workspace in the Resources tool. Note that you can upload a file
into that folder, but once uploaded you can not edit it or delete it –
this is a setting in Collab, but was done to mirror the fact that you
can’t delete images from the Internet once they are placed on the web.
As it is in the Collab workspace, only those in the class can view those
files – but that means anybody in the class can view it.</p>
<p>All image file names should start with your userid and an underscore:
<code>mst3k_foo.jpg</code>. You are going to be uploading multiple image
files in a future assignment, so please plan your file naming scheme
appropriately. You probably won’t need more than three or four such
images for the semester, and you are welcome to generate them all now;
but you’ll just need two different ones for this assignment. As long as
the file name starts with your userid and an underscore, we don’t really
care what (appropriate) alphanumeric string the rest of the file name
is. Only JPEG and PNG images, please.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The filenames, with the extension,
<strong>MUST</strong> be strictly less than 32 characters in length.
This is just for the filename (“mst3k_foo_bar.png”), not the path to
that file name.</p>
<p>We don’t really care what images you upload, as long as:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>They are images that are in the public domain, such as from
Wikipedia (or similar). You can do a <a
href="https://images.google.com">Google Images search</a>, and in the
results, select Tools -&gt; Usage Rights -&gt; Creative Commons
licenses. Meme images are fine. You are welcome to modify those
images.</li>
<li>They are appropriate images. Nothing vulgar, nothing involving
nudity, nothing that could be labeled NSFW (not safe for work), or
otherwise deemed as offensive. Basically, nothing that would get me in
trouble with an administration that does not have a sense of humor about
these things. Like with the <a href="../dappintro/index.html">dApp
introduction</a> (<a href="../dappintro/index.md">md</a>) assignment,
there are many great ways to express your opinions that others may find
controversial – but in an image for a NFT on our private Ethereum
blockchain is not really one of them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Understand this: <strong>IN THIS COURSE, OWNING THE NFT DOES NOT
IMPLY OWNERSHIP OF THE IMAGE.</strong> The assumption is that you don’t
actually own the original image, since it’s in the public domain.</p>
<p>Pick some fun or funny image. You are welcome to pick one from
Wikipedia. Or memes. But something appropriate. And keep in mind that,
like with NFTs on the real Ethereum blockchain, anybody can download the
image.</p>
<h4 id="part-2-task-2-review-the-starter-code">Part 2, task 2: Review
the starter code</h4>
<p>The code we are going to start with is the <a
href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.0.0/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol">OpenZeppelin
ERC-721 implementation</a>. This code was the same as was discussed in
class. Other than the <code>import</code> lines, there have been no
changes to the code in this repo.</p>
<p>In addition to some of the files used above (IERC165.sol. ERC165.sol,
and Context.sol), there are a few additional files that this part uses;
you will need to familiarize yourself with hwo they work.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Address.sol.html">Address.sol</a> (<a
href="Address.sol">src</a>): a library (not a contract!) that provides
some useful functions when dealing with Ethereum addresses</li>
<li><a href="Strings.sol.html">Strings.sol</a> (<a
href="Strings.sol">src</a>): a library (not a contract!) that provides
some useful String manipulation functions</li>
<li><a href="ERC165.sol.html">ERC165.sol</a> (<a
href="ERC165.sol">src</a>): a bare-bones implementation of the
<code>IERC165</code> interface</li>
<li><a href="IERC721.sol.html">IERC721.sol</a> (<a
href="IERC721.sol">src</a>), as <a
href="../../tokens.html#/erc721">discussed in lecture</a>; note that the
ERC-721 interface already inherits from the ERC-165 interface</li>
<li><a href="ERC721.sol.html">ERC721.sol</a> (<a
href="ERC721.sol">src</a>), which is the <a
href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.0.0/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol">OpenZeppelin
ERC-721 implementation</a> – the only changes that were made were to the
<code>import</code> lines</li>
<li><a href="IERC721Metadata.sol.html">IERC721Metadata.sol</a> (<a
href="IERC721Metadata.sol">src</a>): this add three functions on top of
the ERC-721 standard: <code>name()</code>, <code>symbol()</code>, and
<code>tokenURI()</code>; the first two are for the NFT manager, the last
one is the URI (aka URL) of the image that the NFT represents</li>
<li><a href="IERC721full.sol.html">IERC721full.sol</a> (<a
href="IERC721full.sol">src</a>): this adds one more function on top of
the IERC721Metadata interface: <code>mintWithURI()</code>, which allows
creation of an NFT, and setting it’s image URI (aka URL) in one function
call. Note that the <code>mintWithURI()</code> function will return a
token ID, which is just a <code>uint</code> that is used to identify
(and find) that particular NFT in your token manager.</li>
<li><a href="IERC721Receiver.sol.html">IERC721Receiver.sol</a> (<a
href="IERC721Receiver.sol">src</a>): this allows notification that an
NFT has been transferred; we won’t be using this interface in this
assignment (although it is necessary for compilation), but we will be
using it in a future assignment</li>
</ul>
<p>Why so many files? Three of the interfaces (IERC165, IERC721, and
IERC721Metadata) are Ethereum standards, and the practice is to include
them as-is without modifications. Three of the files are utilities
(Address, Context, and Strings). The IERC721full adds one function that
we need, and the ERC721.sol is the implementation itself. We realize
that’s a lot of files to use, but that’s why there are so many of
them.</p>
<p>You should look over and familiarize yourself with this code. The
inheritance hierarchy of this code is shown below. Note that two of the
entries (<code>Address</code> and <code>Strings</code>) are type
substitutions in <code>ERC721.sol</code>. The last one,
<code>IERC721Recevier</code> is used as a casting type.</p>
<p><img src="inheritance.dot.2.svg" /></p>
<h4 id="part-2-task-3-compile-and-test-the-provided-code">Part 2, task
3: Compile and test the provided code</h4>
<p>You should compile the <a href="ERC721.sol.html">ERC721.sol</a> (<a
href="ERC721.sol">src</a>) code in Remix. Deploy it to the Javascript
environment and play with the various functions. Note that you need to
understand what the code in that smart contract does! As this is the
provided code, and does not have all the features that we need
(yet).</p>
<h4 id="part-2-task-4-create-an-nft-manager-for-images">Part 2, task 4:
Create an NFT manager for images</h4>
<p>We are going to assemble all this code together to create an NFT
manager. Most of the code is already done in the <a
href="ERC721.sol.html">ERC721.sol</a> (<a href="ERC721.sol">src</a>). We
are going to create a smart contract called <code>NFTmanager</code> that
will work for image URLs (or any other URL). The updated smart contract
will implement the <a href="IERC721full.sol.html">IERC721full.sol</a>
(<a href="IERC721full.sol">src</a>) interface (and, though inheritance,
a number of other interfaces).</p>
<p>There are some very strict submission requirements for this
submission so that we can grade it in a sane manner:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You must put your name and userid as the second line of the file
(right after the SPDX line)</li>
<li>Your contract MUST be in a file called <code>NFTmanager.sol</code> –
note the capitalization!</li>
<li>Your contract line MUST be: <code>contract NFTmanager is ERC721,
IERC721full {</code>; recall that the IERC721 interface already inherits
from the IERC165 interface</li>
<li>The pragma line should be: <code>pragma solidity ^0.8.7;</code></li>
<li>You are NOT to submit any of the <em>files</em> for the interfaces
above (ERC721, IERC721, IERC721full, or IERC165.sol), nor copy-and-paste
that code in your file. You should <code>import</code> them in
<code>NFTmanager.sol</code>; they will be put into the appropriate
directory on Gradescope when it attempts to compile your program</li>
<li>You cannot submit any files other than the ones in the list above;
any other code must be in your <code>NFTmanager.sol</code> file</li>
</ol>
<p>The following are the functional requirements for the development of
this contract:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementation of the <code>mintWithURI()</code> function
<ul>
<li>Note the second parameter is <em>just</em> the filename
(<code>mst3k_foo.jpg</code>), not the full URI</li>
<li>It should only allow minting by the deployer of the contract</li>
<li>A duplicate URI should cause a reversion</li>
<li>This <em>returns</em> the token ID of the newly minted NFT; the
function itself determines what that ID is (likely the next integer in
sequence)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implementation of the <code>supportsInterface()</code> function for
<em>five</em> interfaces – <code>Context</code>, the three ERC721
interfaces (<code>IERC721</code>, <code>IERC721Metadata</code>, and
<code>IERC721full</code>), and also <code>IERC165</code>
<ul>
<li>Because of the inheritance tree, you will have to specify that it is
overriding <em>all</em> of the <code>supportsInterface()</code> methods;
see the lecture slides for details</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implementation of <code>tokenURI()</code>, which is inherited from
<code>ERC721</code>
<ul>
<li>It should revert if an invalid token ID is provided</li>
<li>It should return the <em>full</em> URL of the file; the first part
of that URL is on the Collab landing page, and the last part of that URL
is what was passed into <code>mintWithURI()</code></li>
<li>This URL base should be hard-coded into the contract itself</li>
<li>You can override the <code>_baseURI()</code> function from
<code>ERC721</code>, and use that in a similar fashion to what is shown
in the <code>tokenURI()</code> function in <code>ERC721</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In theory, you should be able to call <code>mintWithURI()</code> and
capture the return value for the token ID. While this return value is
properly captured when called from another smart contract, Remix does
not always report it. You are allowed to create a <code>uint public
lastCreatedTokenID</code> (or similar) variable which holds the token ID
of the last created token – what should have been returned by
<code>mintWithURI()</code>. THIS WOULD NEVER WORK IN PRACTICE, as it
would create a horrible race condition. But it will work for our
purposes, and allows us to get around this apparent but in Remix.</p>
<p>When you are ready to deploy this token manager, be sure to select
the appropriate contract (“NFTmanager”) from the Contract down-down list
in Remix.</p>
<p>Make sure this works properly in Remix before proceeding onto the
next step.</p>
<h4 id="part-2-task-5-deployment">Part 2, task 5: Deployment</h4>
<p>One you have thoroughly tested your ERC-721 token manager in Remix,
you should deploy it to our private Ethereum blockchain. How to do this
was covered in the <a href="../dappintro/index.html">dApp
Introduction</a> assignment, which you may want to refer back to. You
don’t have to do this from your eth.coinbase account – you can do it
from any account. However, you have to deploy all the code in this
assignment from the same account, and you have to tell us that account
when you submit the Google form at the end of this assignment.</p>
<p>Save the contract address, and the transaction hash, for the
deployment, as you will need to submit it at the end of this
assignment.</p>
<p>Before final submission of this assignment, you will need to deploy
both this token manager and the auction program to our final Ethereum
blockchain. But you don’t have to do that yet – you should ensure it’s
all working via Remix (in the “JavaScript VM (London)” environment)
first.</p>
<h4 id="part-2-task-6-create-two-nfts-and-send-me-one">Part 2, task 6:
Create two NFTs, and send me one</h4>
<p>You should create two NFTs with your deployed contract – they should
be the two images that you created, above. You need to send me one of
them – the address to transfer it to in on the Collab landing page. You
will need to note the tokenID of the two NFTs – the one you sent me and
the one you kept for yourself – as you will need to submit those as
well. You are welcome to create more, if you would like, as long as the
images for each are unique. But we only need two for grading.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>Some common problems encountered, and their solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>“This contract may be abstract, not implement an abstract parent’s
methods completely or not invoke an inherited contract’s constructor
correctly.” – likely this means you are trying to deploy the interface
rather than the contract itself. In Remix, in the Deploy pane, make sure
the correct contract (and not an interface!) is selected in the
“Contract” drop-down list.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="submission">Submission</h3>
<p>There are <em>four</em> forms of submission for this assignment; you
must do all four.</p>
<p>Submission 1: You will need to submit your code to Gradescope; that
code is the <code>TokenCC.sol</code> and <code>NFTmanager.sol</code>
files. Do not submit anything else! <strong>NOTE:</strong> Gradescope
cannot fully test this assignment, as it does not have access to the
private blockchain. So it can only do a few sanity tests (correct files
submitted, successful compilation, etc.).</p>
<p>Submission 2: You must deploy those two smart contracts to our
private Ethereum blockchain. It’s fine if you deploy it a few times to
test it. Save the contract addresses and transaction hashes of these
deployments, as you will need them below.</p>
<p>Submission 3: You will need to submit your information via a Google
form, the link to which is on the Collab landing page. You will need to
submit the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name &amp; UVA userid</li>
<li>Your account number from <code>eth.coinbase</code>. The assumption
is that you did your tasks for this assignment from this account; if you
did it from a different account, submit that account address
instead.</li>
<li>For the ERC-20 (fungible token) part:
<ul>
<li>The contract address and transaction hash of your deployed smart
contract</li>
<li>Your cryptocurrency name and abbreviation; the assumption is that
you have file named <code>xyz.png</code> in the <code>cclogos/</code>
directory of Collab’s Resources tool, where <code>xyz</code> is the
lower-case version of your abbreviation</li>
<li>The transaction hash where you sent me some cryptocurrency</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For the ERC-721 (non-fungible token) part:
<ul>
<li>The contract address and transaction hash of your deployed smart
contract</li>
<li>The token IDs for the NFT you kept and the NFT you sent me; the
assumption is that those NFT images are in the <code>ipfs/</code>
directory of Collab’s Resources tool</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Submission 4: Miscellaneous</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you properly upload your cryptocurrency logo to the
<code>cclogos/</code> directory in Collab’s Resources tool?</li>
<li>Did you properly upload your NFT images to the <code>ipfs/</code>
directory in Collab’s Resources tool?</li>
<li>Did you send me some of your cryptocurrency? The address to transfer
it to in on the Collab landing page.</li>
<li>Did you properly send me one of your NFTs? The address to transfer
it to in on the Collab landing page (it’s the same address to send me
some of your cryptocurrency to).</li>
</ul>
