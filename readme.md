CS 4501: Cryptocurrency
=======================

This repository will hold all the course content for CS 4501: Cryptocurrency, which is going to be taught in the spring 2022 semester at the University of Virginia.  The course has a strict size cap of 90 students, and CS 3710: Introduction to Cybersecurity is a strict pre-req.  It is being taught by [Aaron Bloomfield](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb2t/).

This course is still being developed, so *all the information herein is subject to change*.  This repository is not expected to have any additional content until shortly before the spring semester begins.

### Course Objectives

- Understand all the theoretical aspects of cryptocurrency development and implementation
- Understand the basics of blockchain, as well as understanding the specifics of one particular blockchain
- Understand the uses of cryptocurrency and blockchain beyond those of a currency
- Understand the policy, ethical, legal, and tax implications of cryptocurrency
- Implement a fully working modern cryptocurrency


### Lecture topics

The lecture topics will cover:

- course introduction
- review of encryption and hashing
- overview of cryptocurrency, including the basics of blockchain
- policy, ethical, legal, and tax issues
- specifics of Bitcoin's blockchain
- survey of cryptocurrencies and their features
- economics: money, currency, banking systems, payment systems, etc.
- mining and hashing algorithms
- programming [dApps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application) on cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum
- other blockchain uses including NFTs, tokens, etc.
- peer-to-peer networking
- programming on a GPU in CUDA
- mining pools and cryptocurrency exchanges
- course conclusion


### Assignments

There are three categories of assignments in this course.

- Programming assignments: these are stand-alone programming assignments that are not related to the course project; note that there are other programming assignments are in the Project category, below
    - Introductory programming assignment, similar to [this one](https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/ics/hws/hw-cryptocurrency.html)
    - Blockchain parser: parse a modern blockchain such as Bitcoin and check it for errors
	- Create a [dApp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application) on an modern existing blockchain
- Non-programming assignments: these will explore the legal and ethical aspects of cryptocurrency, as well as a survey of existing cryptocurrencies.
- Project: create a fully functional modern cryptocurrency; the parts of the project are:
    - Design the cryptocurrency and implement the blockchain
	- Implement mining software both as a CPU program and on a GPU using CUDA
	- Implement a peer-to-peer networking solution to allow for the communication between nodes of the cryptocurrency
	- Create a web interface for easy use of the cryptocurrency
	- Create a mining pool service for the cryptocurrency
	- Harden the cryptocurrency against attacks and other errors

### Final notes

This course has received approval from the necessary parts of UVA: [ITS](https://virginia.service-now.com/its/), [InfoSec](https://security.virginia.edu/), and the [Office of the University Counsel](https://universitycounsel.virginia.edu/).  Specifically, the cryptocurrencies created in this course will be exchangable with each other, but not with any cryptocurrency outside the course; thus they have no monetary value.  Because they have no monetary value, and because the activities in this course are necessary to achieve the academic goals of the course, these various activities of this course, including mining, have been judged to be legal.
